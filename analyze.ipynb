      "  Problem Text: When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\n",
      "  Solution:\n",
      "The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\n",
      "  Generated Solution:\n",
      "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$? Solution: \n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to find the area of trapezoid ABCD. The vertices are given as A(1, -2), B(1, 1), C(5, 7), and D(5, 1). Hmm, trapezoid means it has one pair of sides that are parallel. I remember that in a trapezoid, the two parallel sides are called the bases, and the distance between them is the height. The area is then calculated as the average of the two bases multiplied by the height.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should plot these points or at least visualize them to understand the shape. Let me note down the coordinates:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A is at (1, -2)\n",
      "- B is at (1, 1)\n",
      "- C is at (5, 7)\n",
      "- D is at (5, 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the x-coordinates, A and B share the same x-value of 1, while C and D share the same x-value of 5. Similarly, the y-coordinates for A and B are -2 and 1, while for C and D, they are 7 and 1. So, it seems that sides AB and CD are vertical because they share the same x-values. Wait, but AB is from (1, -2) to (1, 1), which is a vertical line. Similarly, CD is from (5, 1) to (5, 7), which is also a vertical line. So, AB and CD are both vertical, meaning they are parallel to each other. Therefore, the trapezoid has two sides that are vertical, which are the bases, and the other two sides are the legs, which are not vertical.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the bases are AB and CD. Now, I need to find their lengths. AB goes from (1, -2) to (1, 1). Since the x-coordinate doesn't change, this is a vertical line. The length is the difference in the y-coordinates. So, from -2 to 1 is a change of 3 units. So, AB is 3 units long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, CD goes from (5, 1) to (5, 7). Again, the x-coordinate doesn't change, so it's vertical. The length is the difference in y-coordinates, which is 7 - 1 = 6 units. So, CD is 6 units long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the height of the trapezoid is the distance between the two parallel sides AB and CD. Since AB and CD are both vertical, the distance between them is the horizontal distance between x=1 and x=5. So, that's 5 - 1 = 4 units. Therefore, the height is 4 units.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: (base1 + base2)/2 * height. Plugging in the values, that's (3 + 6)/2 * 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me compute that step by step. First, 3 + 6 is 9. Then, 9 divided by 2 is 4.5. Then, 4.5 multiplied by 4 is 18. So, the area should be 18 square units.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the bases or the height. AB is vertical from (1, -2) to (1, 1), so length is 3. CD is vertical from (5, 1) to (5, 7), so length is 6. The distance between AB and CD is the horizontal distance between x=1 and x=5, which is 4. So, plugging into the formula: (3 + 6)/2 * 4 = (9/2)*4 = 4.5*4 = 18. Yes, that seems correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can think of the trapezoid as a rectangle minus some parts. But in this case, since it's a trapezoid with vertical sides, maybe that's not the easiest way. But the formula seems solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait another thought: sometimes, the height is not the horizontal distance if the sides are not vertical. But in this case, since both AB and CD are vertical, the height is indeed the horizontal distance between their x-values. So, that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I'm confident that the area is 18 square units.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The area of trapezoid ABCD is calculated by finding the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) and the height, then applying the formula for the area of a trapezoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify the bases and height:**\n",
      "   - AB and CD are vertical sides, so they are the bases.\n",
