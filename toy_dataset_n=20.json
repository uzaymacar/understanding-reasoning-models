Solution: \n<think>\nI'll simplify this expression using exponent rules. First, let me expand the expression:\n(3x^2y^3)^4 ÷ (6xy^2)^2\n\nExpanding the numerator: (3x^2y^3)^4 = 3^4 × (x^2)^4 × (y^3)^4 = 81 × x⁸ × y¹^2\n\nExpanding the denominator: (6xy^2)^2 = 6^2 × x^2 × (y^2)^2 = 36 × x^2 × y^4\n\nNow, dividing: (81 × x⁸ × y¹^2) ÷ (36 × x^2 × y^4) = (81/36) × x^(8-2) × y^(12-4) = (9/4) × x⁶ × y⁸\n\nWait, I made an error. Let me recalculate. 3^4 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81, so the numerator is correct.\n\nFor the denominator: 6^2 = 6 × 6 = 36, so that part is also correct.\n\nSo the final answer is (9/4) × x⁶ × y⁸ = (9x⁶y⁸)/4\n</think>\n\nTo simplify (3x^2y^3)^4 ÷ (6xy^2)^2, I'll apply the exponent rules.\n\nStep 1: Expand the expressions using the power rule (a^m)^n = a^(m×n).\n(3x^2y^3)^4 = 3^4 × (x^2)^4 × (y^3)^4 = 3^4 × x^(2×4) × y^(3×4) = 81 × x⁸ × y¹^2\n(6xy^2)^2 = 6^2 × x^2 × (y^2)^2 = 36 × x^2 × y^4\n\nStep 2: Perform the division using the quotient rule a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n).\n(81 × x⁸ × y¹^2) ÷ (36 × x^2 × y^4)\n= (81/36) × x^(8-2) × y^(12-4)\n= (81/36) × x⁶ × y⁸\n\nStep 3: Simplify the coefficient.\n81/36 = 9/4\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is \\boxed{\\frac{9x^6y^8}{4}}",
