Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least positive integer that satisfies four different conditions. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.\n\na) When divided by 2, the remainder is 1.\n\nb) When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n\nc) When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nd) When divided by 5, the remainder is 4.\n\nHmm, each of these conditions says something about the remainder when the number is divided by a certain number. It seems like the number is one less than a multiple of each of these divisors. Let me think about that.\n\nFor example, condition a says when divided by 2, the remainder is 1. That means the number is an odd number because when you divide by 2, the only possible remainders are 0 and 1. So the number has to be 1 more than an even number, which is the same as saying it's an odd number.\n\nSimilarly, condition b says when divided by 3, the remainder is 2. So the number is 2 more than a multiple of 3. The same logic applies to the other conditions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number minus 1 has to be a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5. Because each of these conditions can be rewritten as:\n\nNumber - 1 \u2261 0 mod 2\n\nNumber - 1 \u2261 0 mod 3\n\nNumber - 1 \u2261 0 mod 4\n\nNumber - 1 \u2261 0 mod 5\n\nSo that means Number - 1 is a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers: 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWait, so I need to find the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 first. Let me do that.\n\nBreaking each number down into its prime factors:\n\n2 = 2\n\n3 = 3\n\n4 = 2\u00b2\n\n5 = 5\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime numbers present. So:\n\n2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 60\n\nSo the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60.\n\nThat means that Number - 1 must be 60, or 120, or 180, etc., because each is a multiple of 60. Since we're looking for the least positive integer, we'll take the smallest multiple, which is 60.\n\nTherefore, Number = 60 + 1 = 61.\n\nLet me check if 61 satisfies all the conditions.\n\na) 61 \u00f7 2 = 30 with a remainder of 1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nb) 61 \u00f7 3 = 20 with a remainder of 1. Wait, that's not matching the condition which says the remainder should be 2. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check my math. 61 divided by 3 is 20 with a remainder of 1, but the condition says the remainder should be 2. So that's not right. Did I miscompute something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the LCM. Let me check again.\n\n2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nThe prime factors:\n\n2: 2\n\n3: 3\n\n4: 2\u00b2\n\n5: 5\n\nSo the LCM is the product of the highest powers: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 60. So that's correct.\n\nSo Number - 1 = 60, so Number = 61. But when I check the conditions, it's not satisfying all of them.\n\nWait, that suggests that my approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to find a number that is one more than a multiple of each of these numbers, but perhaps I'm not considering that the number minus one needs to be divisible by each of these numbers.\n\nBut let's see, 61 - 1 = 60, which is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWait, so 60 is divisible by all these numbers. So 61 should satisfy all the conditions.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that 61 \u00f7 3 gives a remainder of 1, but according to the problem, the remainder should be 2. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo something's wrong here. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the conditions.\n\nLet me re-examine the conditions.\n\na) When divided by 2, the remainder is 1.\n\nb) When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n\nc) When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nd) When divided by 5, the remainder is 4.\n\nSo each condition says that the remainder is one less than the divisor. Because 2-1=1, 3-1=2, 4-1=3, 5-1=4.\n\nSo, in general, the remainder is divisor minus 1.\n\nSo, the number can be expressed as:\n\nNumber = (divisor - 1) \u00d7 k + (divisor - 1) for some k.\n\nWait, that might not be the best way to express it.\n\nAlternatively, the number can be expressed as:\n\nNumber = (divisor - 1) \u00d7 m + (divisor - 1) ?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the number is one less than a multiple of each divisor.\n\nWait, but that would mean that Number = LCM(2,3,4,5) \u00d7 k - 1.\n\nBut earlier, I thought Number = LCM(2,3,4,5) \u00d7 k + 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm mixing up the two.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIf the remainder when divided by 2 is 1, then the number is of the form 2k + 1.\n\nSimilarly, when divided by 3, the remainder is 2: 3m + 2.\n\nWhen divided by 4, remainder is 3: 4n + 3.\n\nWhen divided by 5, remainder is 4: 5p + 4.\n\nSo, each condition can be expressed as:\n\nNumber \u2261 1 mod 2\n\nNumber \u2261 2 mod 3\n\nNumber \u2261 3 mod 4\n\nNumber \u2261 4 mod 5\n\nSo, all these congruences need to be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nSo, another way to think about this is that Number \u2261 -1 mod 2, since 1 \u2261 -1 mod 2.\n\nSimilarly, Number \u2261 -1 mod 3, because 2 \u2261 -1 mod 3.\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 4, because 3 \u2261 -1 mod 4.\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 5, because 4 \u2261 -1 mod 5.\n\nSo, all of these can be written as:\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 2\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 3\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 4\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 5\n\nWhich means that Number + 1 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nSo, Number + 1 is a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, Number + 1 must be the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nWait, but the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, Number + 1 = 60, so Number = 59.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Number = 61. Now, with this approach, it's 59.\n\nBut let's check both.\n\nFirst approach: Number + 1 = 60, so Number = 59.\n\nCheck conditions:\n\na) 59 \u00f7 2 = 29 with remainder 1. Correct.\n\nb) 59 \u00f7 3 = 19 with remainder 2. Correct.\n\nc) 59 \u00f7 4 = 14 with remainder 3. Correct.\n\nd) 59 \u00f7 5 = 11 with remainder 4. Correct.\n\nSo all conditions are satisfied by 59.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Number = 61 because I added 1 to the LCM, but that was incorrect. Because the LCM is 60, so adding 1 gives 61, but that's not the correct approach.\n\nInstead, Number + 1 is the LCM, so Number = LCM - 1.\n\nSo, Number = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that satisfies all four conditions is 59.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that 61 worked. So why is 59 correct?\n\nBecause 61 - 1 = 60, which is divisible by all the divisors, so 61 would also satisfy all the conditions.\n\nWait, let me check 61:\n\na) 61 \u00f7 2 = 30 with remainder 1. Correct.\n\nb) 61 \u00f7 3 = 20 with remainder 1. Wait, but the condition says the remainder should be 2. So that's a problem.\n\nSo 61 doesn't satisfy the condition b).\n\nSo, 61 is incorrect.\n\nSo, 60 + 1 = 61 is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, Number = 60 \u00d7 k - 1.\n\nWait, no, the approach was that Number + 1 = LCM, so Number = LCM - 1.\n\nTherefore, 59 is correct.\n\nBut let's see, what's wrong with 61.\n\n61: 61 \u00f7 2 = 30 rem 1.\n\n61 \u00f7 3 = 20 rem 1. But condition says rem 2. So 61 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, 59 is correct.\n\nWait, but then why did I think 61 worked? Because I thought Number = LCM + 1, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. If Number \u2261 -1 mod 2, 3, 4, 5, then Number + 1 is divisible by 2,3,4,5. So the smallest such number is LCM - 1.\n\nSo, LCM is 60, so Number = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\nSo 59 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with 59.\n\n59 \u00f7 2 = 29 rem 1.\n\n59 \u00f7 3 = 19 rem 2.\n\n59 \u00f7 4 = 14 rem 3.\n\n59 \u00f7 5 = 11 rem 4.\n\nAll conditions satisfied.\n\nNow, let's check 61.\n\n61 \u00f7 2 = 30 rem 1.\n\n61 \u00f7 3 = 20 rem 1. But condition says rem 2. So 61 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, 59 is correct.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that 61 worked. So I must have made a mistake in my initial reasoning.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nEach condition can be written as:\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 2\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 3\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 4\n\nNumber \u2261 -1 mod 5\n\nSo, Number + 1 is divisible by 2,3,4,5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest such number is LCM(2,3,4,5) - 1.\n\nWhich is 60 - 1 = 59.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer is 59.\n\nI think I initially thought 61 was correct, but that was because I thought Number = LCM + 1, which is incorrect. It should be Number = LCM - 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 59.\n</think>\n\nThe least positive integer that satisfies all the given conditions is **59**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand Each Condition:**\n   Each condition specifies that when the number is divided by a certain divisor, the remainder is one less than the divisor. For example:\n   - When divided by 2, remainder is 1.\n   - When divided by 3, remainder is 2.\n   - And so on.\n\n2. **Express Each Condition as a Congruence:**\n   Each condition can be written as:\n   - Number \u2261 -1 mod 2\n   - Number \u2261 -1 mod 3\n   - Number \u2261 -1 mod 4\n   - Number \u2261 -1 mod 5\n\n3. **Combine the Congruences:**\n   Since all these conditions require the number to be one less than a multiple of each divisor, the number plus one must be a common multiple of all these divisors. Therefore, the smallest such number is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM:**\n   - Prime factors:\n     - 2 = 2\n     - 3 = 3\n     - 4 = 2\u00b2\n     - 5 = 5\n   - LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 60.\n\n5. **Determine the Number:**\n   The number must be one less than the LCM of these divisors. Therefore:\n   - Number = LCM - 1 = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   Check that 59 satisfies all the original conditions:\n   - 59 \u00f7 2 = 29 rem 1\n   - 59 \u00f7 3 = 19 rem 2\n   - 59 \u00f7 4 = 14 rem 3\n   - 59 \u00f7 5 = 11 rem 4\n   All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Final Answer:** The least positive integer is \\boxed{59}.",

Problem: Two of the roots of the equation \\[ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\\]are $3$ and $-2.$ Given that $a \\neq 0,$ compute $\\frac{b+c}{a}.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where two of the roots of the cubic equation ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0 are given as 3 and -2. And I have to find the value of (b + c)/a. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, if you know the roots, you can factor the polynomial into its linear terms. Since the equation is a cubic, it should have three roots. Two of them are given as 3 and -2, so the third one must be something I can find.\n\nLet me denote the third root as r. So, the polynomial can be written as a(x - 3)(x + 2)(x - r). Expanding this should give me the coefficients in terms of a and r, and then I can relate them to b, c, and d.\n\nLet me start by expanding the factors step by step. First, multiply (x - 3) and (x + 2). So, (x - 3)(x + 2) = x\u00b2 + 2x - 3x - 6 = x\u00b2 - x - 6. Okay, that's one part.\n\nNow, I need to multiply this result by (x - r). So, (x\u00b2 - x - 6)(x - r) = x\u00b3 - r x\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + r x - 6x + 6r. Wait, let me check that again. Multiplying term by term:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 * x = x\u00b3\nThen, x\u00b2 * (-r) = -r x\u00b2\nNext, (-x) * x = -x\u00b2\nThen, (-x) * (-r) = r x\nNext, (-6) * x = -6x\nThen, (-6) * (-r) = 6r\n\nSo, combining all these terms, we have x\u00b3 - r x\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + r x - 6x + 6r.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The x\u00b3 term is just x\u00b3. The x\u00b2 terms are -r x\u00b2 and -x\u00b2, so combining them gives (-r - 1)x\u00b2. The x terms are r x - 6x, which is (r - 6)x. And the constant term is 6r.\n\nSo, the polynomial is x\u00b3 + (-r - 1)x\u00b2 + (r - 6)x + 6r.\n\nBut wait, the original polynomial is ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d. So, comparing these two, we can see that:\n\na must be 1 because the coefficient of x\u00b3 in the expanded polynomial is 1, and since the original equation is ax\u00b3 + ..., it must be that a = 1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's given that a \u2260 0, but it doesn't say that a \u2260 1. Hmm, but in my expansion, I assumed a was 1. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming a was 1. Let me see. The original polynomial is ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d, and I factored it as a(x - 3)(x + 2)(x - r). So, expanding that, I get a x\u00b3 + ... and the coefficients would be a, b, c, d, etc.\n\nSo, when I expanded (x - 3)(x + 2)(x - r), I got x\u00b3 + (-r - 1)x\u00b2 + (r - 6)x + 6r. So, when I multiply by a, it becomes a x\u00b3 + a(-r - 1)x\u00b2 + a(r - 6)x + a*6r. Therefore, the coefficients of the original polynomial are:\n\nb = a(-r - 1)\nc = a(r - 6)\nd = 6a r\n\nSo, that's how the coefficients relate to each other. Now, the problem asks for (b + c)/a. Let's compute that.\n\nb + c = a(-r - 1) + a(r - 6) = a(-r - 1 + r - 6) = a(-7). Therefore, (b + c)/a = (-7)/a * a = -7.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, factored the polynomial as a(x - 3)(x + 2)(x - r). Expanded (x - 3)(x + 2) to get x\u00b2 - x - 6, then multiplied by (x - r) to get x\u00b3 + (-r - 1)x\u00b2 + (r - 6)x + 6r. Then, multiplied by a to get a x\u00b3 + a(-r - 1)x\u00b2 + a(r - 6)x + 6a r. Therefore, coefficients are:\n\nb = a(-r - 1)\nc = a(r - 6)\nd = 6a r\n\nThus, b + c = a(-r - 1) + a(r - 6) = a(-r -1 + r -6) = a(-7). So, (b + c)/a = -7.\n\nWait, that seems too easy. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.\n\nGiven that the polynomial is ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, and the roots are 3, -2, and r.\n\nAccording to Vieta's formulas:\n\nSum of roots: 3 + (-2) + r = 1 + r = -b/a\n\nProduct of roots: 3*(-2)*r = -6r = -d/a\n\nSum of products of roots two at a time: 3*(-2) + 3*r + (-2)*r = (-6) + (3r) + (-2r) = -6 + r = c/a\n\nSo, from the sum of products, c/a = -6 + r\n\nFrom the product of roots, -6r = -d/a, so d = 6a r\n\nFrom the sum of roots, 1 + r = -b/a\n\nFrom the sum of products, c/a = -6 + r\n\nNow, the problem asks for (b + c)/a. Let's express b and c in terms of r.\n\nFrom the sum of roots: 1 + r = -b/a \u21d2 b = -a(1 + r)\n\nFrom the sum of products: c = a(-6 + r)\n\nSo, b + c = -a(1 + r) + a(-6 + r) = a(-1 - r -6 + r) = a(-7)\n\nTherefore, (b + c)/a = -7.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be -7.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the given cubic equation has roots 3 and -2. Let the third root be r. The polynomial can be factored as:\n\n\\[ a(x - 3)(x + 2)(x - r) \\]\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n\\[ a(x^3 - rx^2 - x^2 + rx - 6x + 6r) \\]\n\\[ = a(x^3 - (r + 1)x^2 + (r - 6)x + 6r) \\]\n\nComparing this with the standard form \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= -a(r + 1) \\\\\nc &= a(r - 6) \\\\\nd &= 6ar\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe are asked to compute \\( \\frac{b + c}{a} \\). Substituting the expressions for b and c:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b + c}{a} = \\frac{-a(r + 1) + a(r - 6)}{a} = \\frac{-a(r + 1 - r + 6)}{a} = \\frac{-a(7)}{a} = -7\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( \\frac{b + c}{a} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-7}\n\\]",

Problem: In trapezoid $ABCD$, sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are parallel, $\\angle A = 2\\angle D$, and $\\angle C = 3\\angle B$.  Find $\\angle A$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this trapezoid problem to solve. Let me try to visualize it first. In trapezoid ABCD, sides AB and CD are parallel. That means AB is one base, and CD is the other base. The other sides are AD and BC. \n\nThe problem states that angle A is twice angle D. So, if I let angle D be some measure, angle A would be double that. Similarly, angle C is three times angle B. So, angle C is a larger angle compared to angle B.\n\nSince AB and CD are parallel, the consecutive angles between them should be supplementary. That is, angle A and angle D should add up to 180 degrees because they are on the same side of the transversal. Similarly, angle B and angle C should add up to 180 degrees.\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, in a trapezoid, each pair of adjacent angles on the same base are supplementary. So, that means angle A and angle D are supplementary, and angle B and angle C are supplementary. That makes sense because the bases are parallel, so the angles adjacent to each other should add up to 180 degrees.\n\nSo, let me note that down:\n\n- Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0\n- Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0\n\nGiven that angle A = 2 angle D, I can write angle A as 2x and angle D as x, where x is some angle measure. Similarly, angle C is three times angle B, so I can write angle C as 3y and angle B as y, where y is another angle measure.\n\nNow, substituting these into the supplementary angle equations:\n\n1. Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0\n   2x + x = 180\u00b0\n   3x = 180\u00b0\n   x = 60\u00b0\n\nSo, angle D is 60\u00b0, and angle A is 2x, which is 120\u00b0. That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me check the other pair of angles to make sure everything adds up correctly.\n\n2. Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0\n   y + 3y = 180\u00b0\n   4y = 180\u00b0\n   y = 45\u00b0\n\nSo, angle B is 45\u00b0, and angle C is 3y, which is 135\u00b0. Let me verify if all the angles in the trapezoid add up to 360\u00b0, as the sum of interior angles in any quadrilateral is 360\u00b0.\n\nSum of angles:\n\nAngle A = 120\u00b0\nAngle D = 60\u00b0\nAngle B = 45\u00b0\nAngle C = 135\u00b0\n\nAdding them up: 120 + 60 + 45 + 135 = 360\u00b0, which checks out.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the supplementary angles. Sometimes, I get confused whether the angles are on the same side or not. But in a trapezoid, the consecutive angles along each base should be supplementary.\n\nSo, for example, angle A and angle D are on the same base, so they should be supplementary. Similarly, angle B and angle C are on the same base, so they should be supplementary. That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my solution is solid. Angle A is 120\u00b0, angle D is 60\u00b0, angle B is 45\u00b0, and angle C is 135\u00b0, which all add up to 360\u00b0, and the supplementary conditions are satisfied.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It all seems to line up correctly. So, I'm confident that angle A is 120 degrees.\n</think>\n\nThe measure of angle A is 120 degrees.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Given Information:**\n   - In trapezoid ABCD, sides AB and CD are parallel.\n   - Angle A = 2 \u00d7 Angle D.\n   - Angle C = 3 \u00d7 Angle B.\n\n2. **Use the Property of Trapezoids:**\n   - Consecutive angles between the non-parallel sides are supplementary.\n   - Therefore, Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0.\n   - Similarly, Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0.\n\n3. **Let Variables Represent the Angles:**\n   - Let Angle D = x, so Angle A = 2x.\n   - Let Angle B = y, so Angle C = 3y.\n\n4. **Set Up Equations Based on Supplementary Angles:**\n   - From Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0:\n     2x + x = 180\u00b0\n     3x = 180\u00b0\n     x = 60\u00b0\n     Therefore, Angle D = 60\u00b0, Angle A = 120\u00b0.\n\n   - From Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0:\n     y + 3y = 180\u00b0\n     4y = 180\u00b0\n     y = 45\u00b0\n     Therefore, Angle B = 45\u00b0, Angle C = 135\u00b0.\n\n5. **Verify the Sum of All Angles:**\n   - 120\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 45\u00b0 + 135\u00b0 = 360\u00b0, which is correct for a quadrilateral.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAngle A measures 120 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to multiply two numbers in base 9 and then express the answer in base 9 as well. The numbers given are 218_9 and 5_9. Hmm, base 9, that's nonary, right? So I think the first step is to convert these base 9 numbers into base 10, multiply them, and then convert the result back into base 9. That sounds manageable.\n\nLet me start by converting 218_9 into base 10. I remember that each digit in a number represents a power of the base. So for a three-digit number, the rightmost digit is 9^0, then the middle is 9^1, and the leftmost is 9^2. So applying that to 218_9:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 8, which is 8 * 9^0. Since 9^0 is 1, that's just 8.\n- The middle digit is 1, which is 1 * 9^1. 9^1 is 9, so that's 9.\n- The leftmost digit is 2, which is 2 * 9^2. 9^2 is 81, so that's 2 * 81 = 162.\n\nNow, adding them all together: 162 + 9 + 8 = 179. So 218_9 in base 10 is 179.\n\nNext, I need to convert 5_9 into base 10. That's simpler since it's a single digit. In base 10, it's just 5. So 5_9 is 5 in base 10.\n\nNow, I can multiply these two base 10 numbers: 179 * 5. Let me calculate that. 179 * 5. Well, 100*5=500, 70*5=350, and 9*5=45. Adding them up: 500 + 350 = 850, plus 45 is 895. So the product in base 10 is 895.\n\nNow, I need to convert 895 back into base 9. To do that, I think I need to find the highest power of 9 that fits into 895 and then determine the coefficients for each power.\n\nLet me list the powers of 9:\n\n- 9^0 = 1\n- 9^1 = 9\n- 9^2 = 81\n- 9^3 = 729\n- 9^4 = 6561 (which is too big since 895 is less than that)\n\nSo the highest power we need is 9^3 = 729. Now, let's see how many times 729 goes into 895.\n\n895 \u00f7 729. Let me calculate that. 729 * 1 = 729, which is less than 895. 729 * 2 = 1458, which is more than 895. So the coefficient for 9^3 is 1.\n\nSubtracting that from 895: 895 - 729 = 166. So now, we have 166 left to convert.\n\nNext, the next lower power is 9^2 = 81. Let's see how many times 81 goes into 166.\n\n81 * 2 = 162, which is less than 166. 81 * 3 = 243, which is too big. So the coefficient for 9^2 is 2.\n\nSubtracting that from 166: 166 - 162 = 4. So now, we have 4 left.\n\nNext, the lower power is 9^1 = 9. Since 9 is larger than 4, the coefficient for 9^1 is 0.\n\nFinally, the last digit is 9^0 = 1. So the coefficient for that is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the coefficients are:\n\n- 9^3: 1\n- 9^2: 2\n- 9^1: 0\n- 9^0: 4\n\nSo the number in base 9 is 1 2 0 4, which is 1204_9.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 218_9:\n\n- 8 * 1 = 8\n- 1 * 9 = 9\n- 2 * 81 = 162\n- Total: 162 + 9 + 8 = 179. That seems correct.\n\n5_9 is just 5 in base 10.\n\n179 * 5 = 895. That's right.\n\nConverting 895 to base 9:\n\n- 729 goes into 895 once, with a remainder of 166.\n- 81 goes into 166 twice, with a remainder of 4.\n- 9 goes into 4 zero times.\n- 1 goes into 4 four times.\n\nSo yes, the base 9 number is 1204_9. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of multiplying \\(218_9 \\cdot 5_9\\) and expressing the answer in base 9, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert \\(218_9\\) to base 10:**\n   \\[\n   218_9 = 2 \\times 9^2 + 1 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 2 \\times 81 + 1 \\times 9 + 8 \\times 1 = 162 + 9 + 8 = 179_{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert \\(5_9\\) to base 10:**\n   \\[\n   5_9 = 5 \\times 9^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5_{10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the base 10 equivalents:**\n   \\[\n   179_{10} \\times 5_{10} = 895_{10}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert \\(895_{10}\\) back to base 9:**\n   - Determine the largest power of 9 less than 895: \\(9^3 = 729\\)\n   - \\(895 \\div 729 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(166\\)\n   - \\(166 \\div 81 = 2\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\)\n   - \\(4 \\div 9 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\)\n   - \\(4 \\div 1 = 4\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\)\n\n   Thus, the base 9 number is \\(1204_9\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{1204_9}",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: What is the slope of the line passing through $(-3,5)$ and $(2,-5)$? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here asking for the slope of a line that passes through two points: (-3, 5) and (2, -5). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the slope of a line is a measure of its steepness, and it's calculated by finding the change in the y-values divided by the change in the x-values between two points on the line. That makes sense because if you have two points, you can draw a line connecting them, and the slope tells you how steep that line is.\n\nSo, to be more precise, the formula for slope (m) is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nWhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two points on the line. Let me make sure I have this right. So, I need to assign the coordinates correctly. Let me label the first point as (x1, y1) and the second point as (x2, y2). So, for the first point (-3, 5), x1 is -3 and y1 is 5. For the second point (2, -5), x2 is 2 and y2 is -5.\n\nOkay, now I can plug these values into the formula. Let's compute the numerator first, which is y2 - y1. So that would be -5 - 5. Wait, that's -5 minus 5, which is -10. So, the numerator is -10.\n\nNow, the denominator is x2 - x1. So, that's 2 - (-3). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so 2 + 3 is 5. So, the denominator is 5.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the slope m is numerator divided by denominator, which is -10 divided by 5. So, m = -10 / 5 = -2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first point: x1 is -3, y1 is 5. Second point: x2 is 2, y2 is -5. So, numerator: y2 - y1 is -5 - 5, which is -10. Denominator: x2 - x1 is 2 - (-3), which is 5. So, m is -10/5, which is -2. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could visualize this. If I plot the points (-3,5) and (2,-5), the line connecting them would slope downwards from left to right, which means the slope is negative. So, a negative slope makes sense here.\n\nLet me also think about another way to compute this, just to confirm. Maybe using the rise over run method. So, if I move from (-3,5) to (2,-5), how much do I rise? That's from 5 to -5, which is a change of -10. And how much do I run? That's from -3 to 2, which is a change of 5. So, rise over run is -10/5, which is -2. Yep, same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the slope is -2. It's always good to check my work, especially when dealing with negative numbers because it's easy to mix up the signs. But in this case, both methods gave me the same answer, so I don't think I made any mistakes.\n\nAnother thing I could do is plug in the values into the slope formula again, just to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. So, y2 is -5, y1 is 5. So, -5 minus 5 is -10. x2 is 2, x1 is -3. So, 2 minus (-3) is 2 + 3, which is 5. So, -10 divided by 5 is -2. Yep, same result.\n\nAlright, I think I've thought through this problem thoroughly and checked my work multiple times. It looks like the slope is indeed -2.\n</think>\n\nThe slope of the line passing through the points (-3, 5) and (2, -5) is calculated using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm = (-5 - 5) / (2 - (-3)) = (-10) / (5) = -2\n\n**Answer:** The slope of the line is \\boxed{-2}.",

So, in mathematical terms, \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

What is the maximum possible number of handshakes, assuming that any two people can shake hands at most once? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where 23 people attend a party. Each person can shake hands with at most 22 other people. I need to find the maximum possible number of handshakes, with the condition that any two people can shake hands at most once. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with handshakes or connections between people, it's often related to combinations. Like, if there are n people and each can shake hands with n-1 others, the total number of possible handshakes would be the combination of n people taken 2 at a time, which is n(n-1)/2. That makes sense because each handshake is between two people.\n\nSo, applying that to this problem, with 23 people, the maximum number of handshakes would be 23 times 22 divided by 2. Let me write that out:\n\n23 * 22 / 2 = (23 * 22) / 2\n\nCalculating 23 * 22 first: 23 * 20 is 460, and 23 * 2 is 46, so 460 + 46 = 506. Then divide that by 2: 506 / 2 = 253.\n\nSo, according to that, the maximum number of handshakes would be 253.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem states that each person can shake hands with at most 22 others. That means each person can shake hands with 22 people, but in reality, the maximum number of handshakes for the entire party would be the sum of all individual handshakes divided by 2, because each handshake is counted twice when you add up all the individual counts.\n\nSo, if each of the 23 people can shake hands with 22 others, the total number of handshakes would be 23 * 22. But since each handshake is counted twice in this total, we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of unique handshakes. That gives us (23 * 22) / 2 = 253, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of handshakes is 253.\n\nWait a second, I'm wondering if there's any restriction I'm missing here. The problem says each person can shake hands with at most 22 others, but does that mean that in the entire party, each person can only have 22 handshakes, or is it that each person can only have 22 handshakes regardless of the others? I think it's the latter\u2014each person can only have 22 handshakes, regardless of how many others are at the party. So, in the context of the party, each person can only shake hands with 22 others, but the overall party can have more handshakes because different people can shake hands with different numbers of people.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. If each person can shake hands with 22 others, that means each person is not shaking hands with one person. So, in the entire party, each person is not shaking hands with one person, but the total number of handshakes would still be 23 * 22 / 2, which is 253. So, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me think of a simpler example to test this. Suppose there are 2 people at a party. Each person can shake hands with 1 other person. So, the maximum number of handshakes would be 1. Using the formula: 2 * 1 / 2 = 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 3 people. Each person can shake hands with 2 others. The maximum number of handshakes would be 3. Using the formula: 3 * 2 / 2 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSo, applying this to 23 people, each shaking hands with 22 others, the maximum number of handshakes would indeed be 253.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't think of any scenario where this wouldn't apply, unless there's some kind of restriction I'm not considering, like people not shaking hands with certain people, but the problem doesn't mention that. It just says each person can shake hands with at most 22 others, and the maximum number of handshakes is when everyone is shaking hands with everyone else except themselves.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that 253 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the maximum number of handshakes at a party with 23 people, where each person can shake hands with at most 22 others, we use the combination formula for choosing 2 people out of 23:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{23 \\times 22}{2} = 253\n\\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:** We have 23 people, and each can shake hands with 22 others. We need to find the maximum unique handshakes.\n\n2. **Apply Combination Formula:** The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 23 is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum Handshakes:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{23 \\times 22}{2} = \\frac{506}{2} = 253\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The maximum possible number of handshakes is \\boxed{253}.",

Problem: Consider the lines \\begin{align*}\ny&=3x+5 \\\\ 2y&=4x+5 \\\\ 3y&=9x-2 \\\\ 2y&=x-3 \\\\ 4y&=x-5.\n\\end{align*}Let's say that a pair of lines is $\\emph{good}$ if the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other.  Among all the pairs of lines shown, how many pairs are good? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem with five lines, and I need to figure out how many pairs of them are \"good.\" A good pair is one where the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other. Let me write down all the lines first to get a clear picture.\n\nThe lines are:\n1. \\( y = 3x + 5 \\)\n2. \\( 2y = 4x + 5 \\)\n3. \\( 3y = 9x - 2 \\)\n4. \\( 2y = x - 3 \\)\n5. \\( 4y = x - 5 \\)\n\nHmm, I notice that some of these equations might be duplicates or can be simplified. Let me simplify each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first line: \\( y = 3x + 5 \\). That's already in slope-intercept form, which is \\( y = mx + b \\), so the slope \\( m \\) here is 3, and the y-intercept \\( b \\) is 5.\n\nSecond line: \\( 2y = 4x + 5 \\). I can simplify this by dividing both sides by 2. That gives \\( y = 2x + \\frac{5}{2} \\). So now, the slope is 2, and the y-intercept is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\nThird line: \\( 3y = 9x - 2 \\). Again, I can divide both sides by 3 to simplify. That gives \\( y = 3x - \\frac{2}{3} \\). So the slope is 3, and the y-intercept is \\( -\\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nFourth line: \\( 2y = x - 3 \\). Let's divide both sides by 2. That gives \\( y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\). So the slope is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and the y-intercept is \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nFifth line: \\( 4y = x - 5 \\). Dividing both sides by 4 gives \\( y = \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} \\). So the slope is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), and the y-intercept is \\( -\\frac{5}{4} \\).\n\nOkay, so now I have all the lines in slope-intercept form, which makes it easier to identify their slopes. Let me list them with their slopes:\n\n1. \\( y = 3x + 5 \\) \u2192 Slope = 3\n2. \\( y = 2x + \\frac{5}{2} \\) \u2192 Slope = 2\n3. \\( y = 3x - \\frac{2}{3} \\) \u2192 Slope = 3\n4. \\( y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\) \u2192 Slope = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n5. \\( y = \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} \\) \u2192 Slope = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nNow, to determine if any pair of lines is \"good,\" I need to check if their slopes are either parallel (same slope) or perpendicular (negative reciprocal of each other). Let me consider each line and see which other lines have slopes that could be parallel or perpendicular to it.\n\nStarting with line 1, slope = 3.\n\n- Line 2: Slope = 2. 3 \u2260 2, so not parallel. 3 \u2260 -1/2, so not perpendicular. So, not a good pair.\n\n- Line 3: Slope = 3. 3 = 3, so this is parallel. So, lines 1 and 3 are a good pair.\n\n- Line 4: Slope = 1/2. 3 \u2260 1/2, so not parallel. 3 \u2260 -2, so not perpendicular. So, not a good pair.\n\n- Line 5: Slope = 1/4. 3 \u2260 1/4, so not parallel. 3 \u2260 -4, so not perpendicular. So, not a good pair.\n\nSo, line 1 forms a good pair with line 3.\n\nNow, moving to line 2, slope = 2.\n\n- Line 1: Slope = 3. 2 \u2260 3, so not parallel. 2 \u2260 -1/3, so not perpendicular. Not a good pair.\n\n- Line 3: Slope = 3. 2 \u2260 3, so not parallel. 2 \u2260 -1/3, so not perpendicular. Not a good pair.\n\n- Line 4: Slope = 1/2. 2 \u2260 1/2, so not parallel. 2 \u2260 -1/ (1/2) = -2, so 2 is not the negative reciprocal of 1/2. Wait, actually, the negative reciprocal of 1/2 is -2, because -1/(1/2) = -2. So, since 2 \u2260 -2, they are not perpendicular. So, not a good pair.\n\nWait, hold on. The negative reciprocal of 1/2 is -2, but 2 and -2 are not negative reciprocals because one is positive and the other is negative. Wait, no, actually, the negative reciprocal is -2, but the slope of the other line is 1/2. So, to check if they are perpendicular, we need to see if 2 * (1/2) = -1. But 2 * (1/2) = 1, which is not equal to -1. So, they are not perpendicular. So, not a good pair.\n\n- Line 5: Slope = 1/4. 2 \u2260 1/4, so not parallel. 2 \u2260 -1/(1/4) = -4, so not perpendicular. So, not a good pair.\n\nSo, line 2 doesn't form a good pair with any other line.\n\nNext, line 3, slope = 3. Wait, we've already considered line 3 with line 1. Let me see if it's a good pair with others.\n\n- Line 1: Already considered, parallel.\n\n- Line 2: Slope = 2. Not parallel, not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 4: Slope = 1/2. 3 \u2260 1/2, so not parallel. 3 \u2260 -1/(1/2) = -2, so not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 5: Slope = 1/4. 3 \u2260 1/4, not parallel, not perpendicular.\n\nSo, line 3 is only a good pair with line 1.\n\nMoving on to line 4, slope = 1/2.\n\n- Line 1: Slope = 3. 1/2 \u2260 3, so not parallel. 1/2 \u2260 -1/3, so not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 2: Slope = 2. 1/2 \u2260 2, so not parallel. 1/2 \u2260 -1/2, so not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 3: Slope = 3. Not parallel, not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 5: Slope = 1/4. 1/2 \u2260 1/4, so not parallel. 1/2 \u2260 -1/(1/4) = -4, so not perpendicular.\n\nSo, line 4 doesn't form any good pairs.\n\nFinally, line 5, slope = 1/4.\n\n- Line 1: Slope = 3. 1/4 \u2260 3, not parallel. 1/4 \u2260 -3, not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 2: Slope = 2. 1/4 \u2260 2, not parallel. 1/4 \u2260 -2, not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 3: Slope = 3. Not parallel, not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 4: Slope = 1/2. 1/4 \u2260 1/2, not parallel. 1/4 \u2260 -2, not perpendicular.\n\nSo, line 5 also doesn't form any good pairs.\n\nWait, but I have already considered line 1 with line 3, so is that the only good pair? Let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other line that could form a good pair?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the slopes.\n\nStarting over, simplifying each equation:\n\n1. \\( y = 3x + 5 \\) \u2192 Slope = 3\n\n2. \\( 2y = 4x + 5 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 2x + 5/2 \\) \u2192 Slope = 2\n\n3. \\( 3y = 9x - 2 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 3x - 2/3 \\) \u2192 Slope = 3\n\n4. \\( 2y = x - 3 \\) \u2192 \\( y = (1/2)x - 3/2 \\) \u2192 Slope = 1/2\n\n5. \\( 4y = x - 5 \\) \u2192 \\( y = (1/4)x - 5/4 \\) \u2192 Slope = 1/4\n\nOkay, so the slopes are correct as above.\n\nNow, let's check all possible pairs.\n\nWe have five lines: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nTotal number of pairs is C(5,2) = 10 pairs.\n\nLet me list all 10 pairs and determine if they are good or not.\n\n1. Line1 & Line2: Slopes = 3 & 2 \u2192 Not parallel (3 \u2260 2), Not perpendicular (3 \u2260 -1/2). Not good.\n\n2. Line1 & Line3: Slopes = 3 & 3 \u2192 Parallel. Good.\n\n3. Line1 & Line4: Slopes = 3 & 1/2 \u2192 3 \u2260 1/2, 3 \u2260 -1/(1/2) = -2. Not good.\n\n4. Line1 & Line5: Slopes = 3 & 1/4 \u2192 3 \u2260 1/4, 3 \u2260 -4. Not good.\n\n5. Line2 & Line3: Slopes = 2 & 3 \u2192 Not parallel, Not perpendicular. Not good.\n\n6. Line2 & Line4: Slopes = 2 & 1/2 \u2192 2 \u2260 1/2, 2 \u2260 -2. Not good.\n\n7. Line2 & Line5: Slopes = 2 & 1/4 \u2192 Not parallel, Not perpendicular. Not good.\n\n8. Line3 & Line4: Slopes = 3 & 1/2 \u2192 Not parallel, Not perpendicular. Not good.\n\n9. Line3 & Line5: Slopes = 3 & 1/4 \u2192 Not parallel, Not perpendicular. Not good.\n\n10. Line4 & Line5: Slopes = 1/2 & 1/4 \u2192 Not parallel, Not perpendicular. Not good.\n\nSo, only one pair, line1 & line3, is good.\n\nWait, but let me double-check line3 & line5. Slopes are 3 and 1/4. So 3 and 1/4. 3 and -1/3 are not equal, so not perpendicular. So, indeed, they are not perpendicular.\n\nSimilarly, line2 & line3: 2 and 3. 2 and -1/2 are not equal, so not perpendicular.\n\nWait, but is there any other pair that I might have missed?\n\nLet me check line4 & line5: 1/2 and 1/4. 1/2 and -1/(1/4) = -4, so not equal. So not perpendicular.\n\nSimilarly, line1 & line2: 3 and 2. Not parallel, not perpendicular.\n\nSo, it seems that the only good pair is line1 and line3.\n\nWait, but I have to make sure I didn't miss any other pair.\n\nWait, another thought: in the original equations, line2 was \\( 2y = 4x +5 \\), which simplifies to \\( y = 2x + 5/2 \\), so slope = 2.\n\nLine3 was \\( 3y = 9x -2 \\), simplifying to \\( y = 3x - 2/3 \\), so slope = 3.\n\nSo, line1 and line3 are both in slope = 3, so parallel.\n\nSimilarly, if any other lines had the same slope, they would form a good pair.\n\nWait, let me check line3: \\( y = 3x - 2/3 \\), so slope = 3.\n\nIs there any other line with slope = 3? Yes, line1.\n\nSo, that's one pair.\n\nAre there any other lines with the same slope?\n\nLooking at all lines, only line1 and line3 have slope = 3.\n\nSimilarly, let's check if any other lines have the same slope.\n\nLine2: 2\n\nLine4: 1/2\n\nLine5: 1/4\n\nSo, no other lines have the same slope.\n\nTherefore, only one pair is good: line1 and line3.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is there any chance that line1 and line3 are both in the same equation?\n\nWait, line1 was \\( y = 3x +5 \\), and line3 was \\( y = 3x - 2/3 \\). So, they are different lines because they have different y-intercepts.\n\nSo, line1 and line3 are distinct lines with the same slope, so they are parallel, hence a good pair.\n\nTherefore, the number of good pairs is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original problem had five lines, and the user said \"how many pairs are good.\" So, in my analysis, I found only one good pair.\n\nBut let me double-check, because sometimes in these problems, people might consider if the lines are the same, but in this case, all lines are distinct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me see if any other lines have the same slope.\n\nLine1: 3\n\nLine2: 2\n\nLine3: 3\n\nLine4: 1/2\n\nLine5: 1/4\n\nSo, yes, only lines1 and 3 have the same slope, so only one pair.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nWait, but let me think again, because in the problem statement, it's written as:\n\n\"Consider the lines \\begin{align*}\ny&=3x+5 \\\\ 2y&=4x+5 \\\\ 3y&=9x-2 \\\\ 2y&=x-3 \\\\ 4y&=x-5.\n\\end{align*}Let's say that a pair of lines is \\emph{good} if the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other. Among all the pairs of lines shown, how many pairs are good?\"\n\nSo, among all the pairs, how many are good.\n\nSo, in my analysis, only one pair is good.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any other pair with slopes that are negative reciprocals?\n\nWait, line1 and line3 have the same slope, 3, so they are parallel.\n\nLine2 and line4: 2 and 1/2. 2 * (1/2) = 1, which is not -1, so not perpendicular.\n\nLine2 and line5: 2 and 1/4. 2 * (1/4) = 1/2 \u2260 -1, so not perpendicular.\n\nLine3 and line4: 3 and 1/2. 3 * (1/2) = 3/2 \u2260 -1, so not perpendicular.\n\nLine3 and line5: 3 and 1/4. 3 * (1/4) = 3/4 \u2260 -1, so not perpendicular.\n\nLine4 and line5: 1/2 and 1/4. 1/2 * (1/4) = 1/8 \u2260 -1, so not perpendicular.\n\nSo, no other pairs are perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, only one pair is good: line1 and line3.\n\nHence, the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many pairs of lines are \"good\" (either parallel or perpendicular), we first convert each line equation to slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\):\n\n1. \\( y = 3x + 5 \\) (slope = 3)\n2. \\( 2y =",

What is the sum of the proper divisors of $432$? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 432. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 432 without leaving a remainder, except for 432 itself. So, essentially, I need to find all the divisors of 432, exclude 432, and then add them up. That should give me the sum of the proper divisors. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how to find all the divisors of 432. I remember that one way to do this is by prime factorization. Once I have the prime factors, I can use the exponents to calculate the total number of divisors, and then list them out. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with 432. Let me divide it by the smallest prime, which is 2. \n\n432 \u00f7 2 = 216\n\n216 is still even, so divide by 2 again.\n\n216 \u00f7 2 = 108\n\n108 is also even, so divide by 2 once more.\n\n108 \u00f7 2 = 54\n\n54 is still even, so divide by 2 again.\n\n54 \u00f7 2 = 27\n\nNow, 27 is not even. Let me try the next prime, which is 3.\n\n27 \u00f7 3 = 9\n\n9 is also divisible by 3.\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\nAnd finally, 3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factors of 432 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3. In exponential form, that would be 2^4 * 3^3.\n\nNow, using the prime factors, I can find the number of divisors. The formula is (exponent of 2 + 1) multiplied by (exponent of 3 + 1). So, that's (4 + 1)*(3 + 1) = 5*4 = 20 divisors. So, 432 has 20 divisors in total.\n\nBut I need the sum of the proper divisors. Since the total number of divisors is 20, and one of them is 432 itself, the sum of all divisors would be the sum of all these proper divisors plus 432. So, if I can find the sum of all divisors, subtract 432, and that would give me the sum of proper divisors.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the sum of all divisors? I think there's a formula for that as well. If a number is expressed as its prime factors, the formula for the sum of its divisors is (1 + p1 + p1^2 + ... + p1^n)*(1 + p2 + p2^2 + ... + p2^m)... where p1, p2, etc., are the prime factors, and n, m are their exponents.\n\nSo, applying that to 432, which is 2^4 * 3^3. The sum of divisors would be (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, for the 2s: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16. Let me add them step by step.\n\n1 + 2 = 3\n\n3 + 4 = 7\n\n7 + 8 = 15\n\n15 + 16 = 31\n\nSo, the sum of the powers of 2 is 31.\n\nNow, for the 3s: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nLet me add them step by step.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n4 + 9 = 13\n\n13 + 27 = 40\n\nSo, the sum of the powers of 3 is 40.\n\nTherefore, the total sum of all divisors is 31 * 40.\n\n31 * 40 is equal to 1240.\n\nSo, the sum of all divisors of 432 is 1240. But since we are interested in the sum of proper divisors, we need to subtract 432 from this total.\n\nSo, 1240 - 432 = 808.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is 808.\n\nWait, let me double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, first, prime factorization:\n\n432 \u00f7 2 = 216\n\n216 \u00f7 2 = 108\n\n108 \u00f7 2 = 54\n\n54 \u00f7 2 = 27\n\n27 \u00f7 3 = 9\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\nSo, yes, that's 2^4 * 3^3.\n\nSum of divisors: (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) = 31 and (1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 40. So, 31 * 40 = 1240.\n\nThen, subtracting 432 from 1240: 1240 - 432.\n\nLet me do this step by step.\n\n1240 - 400 = 840\n\n840 - 32 = 808\n\nSo, yes, 1240 - 432 is 808.\n\nWait a second, another way to check: Maybe if I list out some of the divisors and add them up, it would give me the same result. But listing all 20 divisors would be time-consuming. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a way to calculate the sum without listing them all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use another formula for the sum of proper divisors. I know that the sum of proper divisors is equal to the sum of all divisors minus the number itself. So, that's exactly what I did: Sum of all divisors is 1240, minus 432 is 808.\n\nSo, unless I made a mistake in the prime factorization or the sum calculations, this should be correct.\n\nLet me verify the prime factorization again:\n\n432 \u00f7 2 = 216\n\n216 \u00f7 2 = 108\n\n108 \u00f7 2 = 54\n\n54 \u00f7 2 = 27\n\n27 \u00f7 3 = 9\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\nYes, that's 2^4 * 3^3.\n\nAnd the sum of the powers of 2: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\n\nSum of powers of 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nSo, 31 * 40 = 1240.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 1240 - 432 = 808.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is 808.\n\nI think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the proper divisors of 432 is \\boxed{808}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the proper divisors of 432, we first need to determine its prime factorization. \n\n432 can be factorized as follows:\n- Dividing 432 by 2 repeatedly: \\(432 \\div 2 = 216\\), \\(216 \\div 2 = 108\\), \\(108 \\div 2 = 54\\), \\(54 \\div 2 = 27\\)\n- Dividing 27 by 3 repeatedly: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\), \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\), \\(3 \\div 3 = 1\\)\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 432 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^3\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, we calculate the sum of all divisors of 432:\n- The sum of the powers of 2: \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\\)\n- The sum of the powers of 3: \\(1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\\)\n\nThe total sum of all divisors is \\(31 \\times 40 = 1240\\).\n\nSince we need the sum of the proper divisors, we subtract 432 from the total sum of all divisors:\n- \\(1240 - 432 = 808\\)\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is \\(\\boxed{808}\\).",
