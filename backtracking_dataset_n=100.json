Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this equation involving absolute values and then find the product of all possible values of x. The equation is |x - 7| - 3 = -2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that absolute value equations can have two solutions because the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative. But in this case, I have an equation that equals a specific number, so maybe I can rearrange it to make it easier to solve.\n\nLet me start by isolating the absolute value term. So, I have |x - 7| - 3 = -2. To get rid of the -3 on the left side, I can add 3 to both sides of the equation. That would give me |x - 7| = -2 + 3, which simplifies to |x - 7| = 1. Okay, now that looks simpler.\n\nNow, since the absolute value of something equals 1, that means the expression inside can be either 1 or -1. So, I can set up two separate equations: x - 7 = 1 and x - 7 = -1. Solving each of these will give me the possible values of x.\n\nLet's solve the first one: x - 7 = 1. If I add 7 to both sides, I get x = 1 + 7, which is x = 8. So, one possible value is 8.\n\nNow, solving the second equation: x - 7 = -1. Adding 7 to both sides gives x = -1 + 7, which is x = 6. So, the other possible value is 6.\n\nTherefore, the two possible values of x are 8 and 6. The problem asks for the product of all possible values of x. So, I need to multiply these two numbers together: 8 * 6. Let me calculate that: 8 times 6 is 48.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with |x - 7| - 3 = -2, I added 3 to both sides to get |x - 7| = 1. Then, I split this into two cases: x - 7 = 1 and x - 7 = -1, which gave me x = 8 and x = 6. Multiplying them gives 48. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps properly, so I'm confident that the product of all possible values of x is 48.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( |x - 7| - 3 = -2 \\) and find the product of all possible values of \\( x \\):\n\n1. **Isolate the absolute value term:**\n   \\[\n   |x - 7| - 3 = -2 \\implies |x - 7| = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up two separate equations:**\n   \\[\n   x - 7 = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x - 7 = -1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve each equation for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 1 + 7 = 8 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -1 + 7 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the product of the solutions:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 6 = 48\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]",

Express your answer as a decimal. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the quadratic equation 8x\u00b2 - 38x + 35 = 0 and find the smallest value of x. Hmm, quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, completing the square, or factoring if possible. Let me see if this equation factors easily.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the equation again to make sure I have it right: 8x\u00b2 - 38x + 35 = 0. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to (8 * 35) which is 280 and add up to -38. Wait, but since the middle term is negative, both numbers should be negative. So, I'm looking for two negative numbers that multiply to 280 and add up to -38.\n\nLet me think about the factors of 280. 280 can be broken down into 2 * 140, 4 * 70, 5 * 56, 7 * 40, 8 * 35, 10 * 28, etc. Now, looking for two numbers that add up to 38. Let me check 10 and 28: 10 + 28 = 38. Perfect! So, the numbers are -10 and -28 because they add up to -38 and multiply to 280.\n\nSo, I can rewrite the middle term using these numbers: 8x\u00b2 - 10x - 28x + 35 = 0. Now, let's group the terms: (8x\u00b2 - 10x) + (-28x + 35) = 0. Factor out the common factors from each group. From the first group, I can factor out 2x: 2x(4x - 5). From the second group, I can factor out -7: -7(4x - 5). So, now the equation is 2x(4x - 5) - 7(4x - 5) = 0.\n\nNotice that both terms have a common factor of (4x - 5), so I can factor that out: (4x - 5)(2x - 7) = 0. Now, setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:\n\n4x - 5 = 0 => 4x = 5 => x = 5/4 = 1.25\n\n2x - 7 = 0 => 2x = 7 => x = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nSo, the two solutions are x = 1.25 and x = 3.5. Since the problem asks for the smallest value of x, the answer is 1.25.\n\nWait, let me double-check using the quadratic formula to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). For this equation, a = 8, b = -38, c = 35.\n\nPlugging in the values: x = [38 \u00b1 sqrt((-38)\u00b2 - 4*8*35)] / (2*8). Calculating the discriminant: (-38)\u00b2 = 1444, and 4*8*35 = 1120. So, sqrt(1444 - 1120) = sqrt(324) = 18.\n\nThus, x = [38 \u00b1 18] / 16. Calculating both possibilities:\n\nx = (38 + 18)/16 = 56/16 = 3.5\n\nx = (38 - 18)/16 = 20/16 = 1.25\n\nSo, same results as before. Therefore, the smallest value of x is indeed 1.25.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. It's always good to verify using two different methods to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe quadratic equation \\(8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0\\) can be solved by factoring or using the quadratic formula.

The picture is drawn using Asymptote code, which I can kind of parse out, but I'm not super familiar with it. The Asymptote code draws two overlapping triangles, each with their own labels for angles 1 through 6. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the picture looks like. The code draws two triangles:\n\n1. The first triangle is drawn from the point (3,8) to (10,4) to (1,0) and back to (3,8). So, this is a triangle with vertices at those coordinates.\n2. The second triangle is drawn from (7,8) to (9,0) to (0,4) and back to (7,8). This is another triangle with its own vertices.\n\nEach of these triangles is divided into smaller angles, labeled from 1 to 6. The labels are placed at specific coordinates, so I can infer where each angle is located.\n\nSince the Asymptote code labels each angle with a number, I can assume that each angle is a small angle at a vertex of the triangles. So, the sum of the six angles would be the sum of all the small angles at each vertex of the two triangles.\n\nNow, I need to recall if there's a theorem or principle that relates to the sum of angles in a polygon or triangle. I know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. But this is about two overlapping triangles. \n\nWait, maybe I can consider the entire figure as a combination of these two triangles. If I add up all the angles from both triangles, that should give me the total sum of the six numbered angles. \n\nBut hold on, each triangle has three angles, so two triangles would have six angles in total. That makes sense because the problem mentions six numbered angles. So, if I can find the sum of the interior angles of each triangle and then add them together, that should give me the total sum of all six angles.\n\nSince each triangle's interior angles add up to 180 degrees, two triangles would add up to 360 degrees. Therefore, the sum of the six numbered angles should be 360 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem is about two triangles overlapping, and each triangle has three angles. So, altogether, there are six angles, and each triangle contributes 180 degrees. So, 180 plus 180 is 360 degrees. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I need to consider the specific positions or how the angles are labeled, because regardless of how they're arranged, the sum of the interior angles of each triangle is always 180 degrees. So, adding them together gives the total sum.\n\nSo, to summarize my thought process:\n\n1. Identified the figure as two overlapping triangles.\n2. Understood that each triangle has three angles.\n3. Remembered that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.\n4. Calculated the sum for two triangles by adding 180 + 180 = 360 degrees.\n5. Confirmed that the specific positions or labels of the angles don't affect the sum.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the six numbered angles in the figure is 360 degrees.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the measures of the six numbered angles in the figure is calculated by considering the sum of the interior angles of two triangles. Each triangle contributes 180 degrees, so the total sum is:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ + 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{360}",

The sphere also intersects the $yz$-plane in a circle centered at $(0,4,-7),$ with radius $r.$  Find $r.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where a sphere intersects two different planes, the xy-plane and the yz-plane. The intersections are circles, and I know some details about them. My goal is to find the radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the sphere and the yz-plane. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that when a sphere intersects a plane, the intersection is a circle. The properties of this circle depend on the sphere's center and radius. Specifically, if the sphere has center (a, b, c) and radius R, then the intersection with the xy-plane (where z=0) is a circle with center (a, b, 0) and radius sqrt(R^2 - c^2). Similarly, the intersection with the yz-plane (where x=0) is a circle with center (0, b, c) and radius sqrt(R^2 - a^2).\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. If the sphere is centered at (a, b, c), then the distance from the center to the xy-plane is |c|. So the radius of the intersection circle on the xy-plane should be sqrt(R^2 - c^2). Similarly, the distance from the center to the yz-plane is |a|, so the radius of the intersection circle there would be sqrt(R^2 - a^2). That seems correct.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the problem statement again. It says the sphere intersects the xy-plane in a circle centered at (2,4,0) with radius 1. So that tells us two things: the center of the circle is (2,4,0), which must be the projection of the sphere's center onto the xy-plane. That means the sphere's center has coordinates (2,4,c), where c is some value. Also, the radius of this circle is 1, which is sqrt(R^2 - c^2). So I can write that as:\n\nsqrt(R^2 - c^2) = 1\n\nWhich implies that R^2 - c^2 = 1. Let me note that down as equation (1).\n\nNext, the sphere intersects the yz-plane in a circle centered at (0,4,-7) with radius r. So again, the center of this circle is (0,4,-7), which must be the projection of the sphere's center onto the yz-plane. That means the sphere's center is (a,4,-7), where a is some value. The radius of this circle is r, which is sqrt(R^2 - a^2). So I can write that as:\n\nsqrt(R^2 - a^2) = r\n\nWhich implies that R^2 - a^2 = r^2. Let me note that as equation (2).\n\nNow, I also know that the sphere's center is (2,4,c) from the first intersection with the xy-plane, and (a,4,-7) from the second intersection with the yz-plane. Wait, that can't both be true unless 2 = a and 4 = 4 and c = -7. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because the sphere's center is a single point, so if the projection onto the xy-plane is (2,4,0), then the sphere's center is (2,4,c) for some c. Similarly, the projection onto the yz-plane is (0,4,-7), so the sphere's center is (a,4,-7) for some a. Therefore, the sphere's center must satisfy both conditions: x=2, y=4, z=c and x=a, y=4, z=-7. Therefore, this implies that a=2, c=-7. So the sphere's center is (2,4,-7).\n\nThat makes sense because the center must be the same point, so both conditions give us a=2, c=-7. So now we know the sphere's center is (2,4,-7), and we need to find the radius R.\n\nWait, but we also know from the first intersection with the xy-plane that the radius of the circle is 1. Let's use that to find R. So from the first equation, R^2 - c^2 = 1. Since c is -7, c^2 is 49. So R^2 - 49 = 1, which implies R^2 = 50, so R = sqrt(50) = 5*sqrt(2). Okay, so R is 5*sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's check the second equation to see if it holds. The sphere's radius R is 5*sqrt(2). The center is (2,4,-7). The projection onto the yz-plane is (0,4,-7), so the distance from the center to the yz-plane is |a|, which is |2| = 2. Therefore, the radius of the circle formed by the intersection with the yz-plane should be sqrt(R^2 - a^2) = sqrt(50 - 4) = sqrt(46). But wait, the problem says that the radius is r, so r = sqrt(46). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, let me compute R^2 - a^2. R^2 is 50, a^2 is 4. So 50 - 4 is 46, so sqrt(46) is indeed the radius. So the radius r is sqrt(46). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(46).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that all the steps are correct. Let me go through again.\n\n1. Sphere intersects xy-plane in a circle centered at (2,4,0) with radius 1.\n\n   - The center of the circle on the xy-plane is (2,4,0), so the projection of the sphere's center onto the xy-plane is (2,4,0). Therefore, the sphere's center is (2,4,c).\n\n   - The radius of the circle on the xy-plane is 1, which is equal to sqrt(R^2 - c^2). So sqrt(R^2 - c^2) = 1, which implies R^2 - c^2 = 1.\n\n2. Sphere intersects yz-plane in a circle centered at (0,4,-7) with radius r.\n\n   - The center of the circle on the yz-plane is (0,4,-7), so the projection of the sphere's center onto the yz-plane is (0,4,-7). Therefore, the sphere's center is (a,4,-7).\n\n   - The radius of the circle on the yz-plane is r, which is equal to sqrt(R^2 - a^2). So sqrt(R^2 - a^2) = r.\n\n3. Now, since the sphere's center must be the same point, we can equate the coordinates from both projections.\n\n   - From the xy-plane projection, the center is (2,4,c).\n\n   - From the yz-plane projection, the center is (a,4,-7).\n\n   - Therefore, 2 = a, 4 = 4, and c = -7.\n\n   - So the sphere's center is (2,4,-7).\n\n4. Now, using the first equation to find R.\n\n   - R^2 - c^2 = 1\n\n   - c = -7, so c^2 = 49\n\n   - Therefore, R^2 - 49 = 1 => R^2 = 50 => R = sqrt(50) = 5*sqrt(2).\n\n5. Now, using the second equation to find r.\n\n   - r = sqrt(R^2 - a^2) = sqrt(50 - 4) = sqrt(46).\n\nSo the radius r is sqrt(46). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(46).\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let's compute R^2 - a^2 again.\n\nR^2 is 50, a^2 is 4. 50 - 4 is 46. So sqrt(46) is correct. So yes, the radius r is sqrt(46).\n\nTherefore, the answer is sqrt(46), which I can write as \\boxed{\\sqrt{46}}",

In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here about triangles and similar triangles. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that the lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm. Then, it mentions a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm. The question is asking for the length of the longest side of this similar triangle in centimeters. \n\nOkay, let's start by recalling what similar triangles are. Similar triangles are triangles that have the same shape but different sizes. This means that the corresponding angles are equal, and the sides are in proportion. So, the ratio of the sides in one triangle to the sides in the other triangle is constant. \n\nNow, let's think about the perimeters of these triangles because the problem gives us the perimeter of the similar triangle. The perimeter is the sum of all the sides of the triangle. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the perimeter of the original triangle. The sides are 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm. So, adding those together: 6 + 7 is 13, and 13 + 9 is 22. So, the perimeter of the original triangle is 22 cm. \n\nNext, the similar triangle has a perimeter of 110 cm. So, we have two perimeters now: 22 cm and 110 cm. \n\nSince the triangles are similar, the ratio of their perimeters should be equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides. So, the ratio of the perimeters is 110 cm divided by 22 cm. Let me calculate that: 110 divided by 22 is 5. So, the ratio is 5:1. \n\nThis means that each side of the similar triangle is 5 times longer than the corresponding side of the original triangle. \n\nNow, we need to find the length of the longest side of the similar triangle. The original triangle has sides of 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm. The longest side is 9 cm. \n\nSince each side is scaled by a factor of 5, we multiply 9 cm by 5.

The longest side of the original triangle is 9 cm, so the longest side of the similar triangle is 9 cm \u00d7 5 = 45 cm.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{45}",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to multiply two numbers in base 9 and then express the answer in base 9 as well. The numbers given are 218_9 and 5_9. Hmm, base 9, that's nonary, right? So I think the first step is to convert these base 9 numbers into base 10, multiply them, and then convert the result back into base 9. That sounds manageable.\n\nLet me start by converting 218_9 into base 10. I remember that each digit in a number represents a power of the base. So for a three-digit number, the rightmost digit is 9^0, then the middle is 9^1, and the leftmost is 9^2. So applying that to 218_9:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 8, which is 8 * 9^0. Since 9^0 is 1, that's just 8.\n- The middle digit is 1, which is 1 * 9^1. 9^1 is 9, so that's 9.\n- The leftmost digit is 2, which is 2 * 9^2. 9^2 is 81, so that's 2 * 81 = 162.\n\nNow, adding them all together: 162 + 9 + 8 = 179. So 218_9 in base 10 is 179.\n\nNext, I need to convert 5_9 into base 10. That's simpler since it's a single digit. In base 10, it's just 5. So 5_9 is 5 in base 10.\n\nNow, I can multiply these two base 10 numbers: 179 * 5. Let me calculate that. 179 * 5. Well, 100*5=500, 70*5=350, and 9*5=45. Adding them up: 500 + 350 = 850, plus 45 is 895. So the product in base 10 is 895.\n\nNow, I need to convert 895 back into base 9. To do that, I think I need to find the highest power of 9 that fits into 895 and then determine the coefficients for each power.\n\nLet me list the powers of 9:\n\n- 9^0 = 1\n- 9^1 = 9\n- 9^2 = 81\n- 9^3 = 729\n- 9^4 = 6561 (which is too big since 895 is less than that)\n\nSo the highest power we need is 9^3 = 729. Now, let's see how many times 729 goes into 895.\n\n895 \u00f7 729. Let me calculate that. 729 * 1 = 729, which is less than 895. 729 * 2 = 1458, which is more than 895. So the coefficient for 9^3 is 1.\n\nSubtracting that from 895: 895 - 729 = 166. So now, we have 166 left to convert.\n\nNext, the next lower power is 9^2 = 81. Let's see how many times 81 goes into 166.\n\n81 * 2 = 162, which is less than 166. 81 * 3 = 243, which is too big. So the coefficient for 9^2 is 2.\n\nSubtracting that from 166: 166 - 162 = 4. So now, we have 4 left.\n\nNext, the lower power is 9^1 = 9. Since 9 is larger than 4, the coefficient for 9^1 is 0.\n\nFinally, the last digit is 9^0 = 1. So the coefficient for that is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the coefficients are:\n\n- 9^3: 1\n- 9^2: 2\n- 9^1: 0\n- 9^0: 4\n\nSo the number in base 9 is 1 2 0 4, which is 1204_9.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 218_9:\n\n- 8 * 1 = 8\n- 1 * 9 = 9\n- 2 * 81 = 162\n- Total: 162 + 9 + 8 = 179. That seems correct.\n\n5_9 is just 5 in base 10.\n\n179 * 5 = 895. That's right.\n\nConverting 895 to base 9:\n\n- 729 goes into 895 once, with a remainder of 166.\n- 81 goes into 166 twice, with a remainder of 4.\n- 9 goes into 4 zero times.\n- 1 goes into 4 four times.\n\nSo yes, the base 9 number is 1204_9. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of multiplying \\(218_9 \\cdot 5_9\\) and expressing the answer in base 9, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert \\(218_9\\) to base 10:**\n   \\[\n   218_9 = 2 \\times 9^2 + 1 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 2 \\times 81 + 1 \\times 9 + 8 \\times 1 = 162 + 9 + 8 = 179_{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert \\(5_9\\) to base 10:**\n   \\[\n   5_9 = 5 \\times 9^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5_{10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the base 10 equivalents:**\n   \\[\n   179_{10} \\times 5_{10} = 895_{10}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert \\(895_{10}\\) back to base 9:**\n   - Determine the largest power of 9 less than 895: \\(9^3 = 729\\)\n   - \\(895 \\div 729 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(166\\)\n   - \\(166 \\div 81 = 2\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\)\n   - \\(4 \\div 9 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\)\n   - \\(4 \\div 1 = 4\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\)\n\n   Thus, the base 9 number is \\(1204_9\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{1204_9}",

What is the probability that their product is odd? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the probability that the product of two distinct integers chosen from 5 to 17 inclusive is odd. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many integers are there between 5 and 17 inclusive. Let me count them: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. That's 13 numbers in total. So, there are 13 integers to choose from.\n\nNow, the problem says we need to choose two distinct integers from these 13. So, the total number of ways to choose two distinct integers is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Plugging in the numbers, that's C(13, 2) = 13! / (2! * 11!) = (13 * 12) / (2 * 1) = 78. So, there are 78 possible pairs.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these pairs have an odd product. I remember that the product of two numbers is odd only if both numbers are odd. If at least one of them is even, the product will be even. So, I need to find the number of pairs where both numbers are odd.\n\nTo do that, I first need to know how many odd numbers are there between 5 and 17 inclusive. Let's list them: 5,7,9,11,13,15,17. That's 7 odd numbers. So, there are 7 odd integers in this range.\n\nNow, the number of ways to choose two distinct odd integers from these 7 is C(7, 2). Let's calculate that: C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21. So, there are 21 pairs where both numbers are odd.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes (pairs with an odd product) is 21. The total number of possible pairs is 78. So, the probability that the product is odd is 21/78.\n\nI can simplify this fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3. 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, and 78 \u00f7 3 = 26. So, the simplified probability is 7/26.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I counted 13 numbers correctly, then 7 odd numbers. Then calculated combinations correctly: C(13,2) is 78 and C(7,2) is 21. Then simplified 21/78 to 7/26. Seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability that the product of two distinct integers chosen from 5 to 17 inclusive is odd is 7/26.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the product of two distinct integers chosen from 5 to 17 inclusive is odd is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Total Integers**: 5 to 17 inclusive gives 13 numbers.\n\n2. **Total Pairs**: Number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers from 13 is:\n   \\[\n   C(13, 2) = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2 \\times 1} = 78\n   \\]\n\n3. **Odd Numbers**: Between 5 and 17, the odd numbers are 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 (7 numbers).\n\n4. **Pairs with Odd Product**: Number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers from 7 is:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 2) = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability**: The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{78} = \\frac{7}{26}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}",

Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about probability and silverware. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says there's a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives. I need to find the probability that if I randomly remove three pieces of silverware, I end up with one fork, one spoon, and one knife.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out the total number of ways I can remove three pieces of silverware from the drawer. Since there are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives, that's a total of 18 pieces of silverware. So, the total number of ways to choose any three pieces is the combination of 18 taken 3 at a time, which is written as C(18,3).\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of those combinations consist of one fork, one spoon, and one knife. Since there are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives, the number of ways to choose one of each is 6 (for forks) multiplied by 6 (for spoons) multiplied by 6 (for knives), which is 6*6*6=216.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the total number of ways to choose three pieces is much larger than 216. Let me check my calculations. Oh, no, actually, 6*6*6 is correct for the specific case of one of each type. But I need to compare that to the total number of ways to choose three pieces, which is C(18,3).\n\nLet me calculate C(18,3) properly. The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). So, plugging in n=18 and k=3:\n\nC(18,3) = 18! / (3! * (18-3)!) = 18! / (3! * 15!) \n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 15! in the numerator and denominator:\n\n= (18 * 17 * 16 * 15!) / (3! * 15!) = (18 * 17 * 16) / 3!\n\nNow, 3! is 6, so:\n\n= (18 * 17 * 16) / 6\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, 18 divided by 6 is 3, so:\n\n= 3 * 17 * 16\n\nThen, 3 * 17 is 51, and 51 * 16 is 816.\n\nSo, C(18,3) is 816.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is 216, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 216 / 816.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 24:\n\n216 \u00f7 24 = 9\n\n816 \u00f7 24 = 34\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 9/34.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, I can reduce 216/816 by dividing both by 24 again:\n\n216 \u00f7 24 = 9\n\n816 \u00f7 24 = 34\n\nYes, so 9/34 is the simplified form.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the problem in terms of probabilities step by step. The probability of picking one fork, one spoon, and one knife in any order.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a fork first is 6/18. Then, a spoon is 6/17, and then a knife is 6/16. But since the order can vary, I need to multiply by the number of permutations, which is 3! (since the three pieces can be arranged in any order).\n\nSo, the probability would be (6/18) * (6/17) * (6/16) * 3!.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 3! is 6.\n\nSo, (6/18) * (6/17) * (6/16) * 6.\n\nSimplify each fraction:\n\n6/18 = 1/3\n\n6/17 remains 6/17\n\n6/16 = 3/8\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1/3) * (6/17) * (3/8) * 6\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n1/3 * 6/17 = (6)/(51) = 2/17\n\n2/17 * 3/8 = (6)/(136) = 3/68\n\n3/68 * 6 = 18/68 = 9/34\n\nSo, that gives me the same answer, 9/34.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 9/34.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probability of randomly removing one fork, one spoon, and one knife from a drawer containing 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Total Ways to Choose Three Pieces:**\n   - There are 18 pieces of silverware in total.\n   - The number of ways to choose any three is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n   - \\( C(18, 3) = \\frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 816 \\).\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - We need to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife.\n   - There are 6 choices for each type, so the number of favorable combinations is \\( 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\).\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.\n   - \\( \\text{Probability} = \\frac{216}{816} = \\frac{9}{34} \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{34}}",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: Sasha has $\\$3.20$ in U.S. coins. She has the same number of quarters and nickels. What is the greatest number of quarters she could have? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where Sasha has $3.20 in U.S. coins. She has the same number of quarters and nickels. I need to find the greatest number of quarters she could have. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that U.S. coins include pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half-dollars, etc. But since Sasha only has quarters and nickels in the same number, I don't need to worry about pennies or dimes for this particular problem. That simplifies things a bit.\n\nSo, the coins we're dealing with are quarters and nickels. Let's denote the number of quarters as Q. Since she has the same number of nickels as quarters, the number of nickels is also Q. Let's call the number of dimes or pennies something else, maybe D, but since we're focusing on quarters and nickels, I can set D to zero for now. Wait, but the problem doesn't say she only has quarters and nickels; it says she has U.S. coins, which could include pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, etc. So, I need to consider all types of coins.\n\nBut wait, the problem says she has the same number of quarters and nickels. It doesn't say anything about the number of pennies or dimes. So, I need to account for those as well. Let me define variables for each type of coin:\n\n- Q = number of quarters\n- N = number of nickels\n- D = number of dimes\n- P = number of pennies\n\nBut according to the problem, N = Q. So, N = Q.\n\nNow, the total amount of money Sasha has is $3.20, which is 320 cents. So, the total value in cents is:\n\nQ * 25 + N * 5 + D * 10 + P * 1 = 320\n\nSince N = Q, we can substitute that in:\n\nQ * 25 + Q * 5 + D * 10 + P * 1 = 320\n\nSimplify that:\n\n25Q + 5Q + 10D + P = 320\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n30Q + 10D + P = 320\n\nHmm, so we have an equation here with three variables: Q, D, and P. We need to find the maximum possible value of Q, given that Q, D, and P are non-negative integers (since you can't have a negative number of coins).\n\nSo, let's try to express this equation in terms of Q:\n\n30Q + 10D + P = 320\n\nWe can factor out 10 from the first two terms:\n\n10(3Q + D) + P = 320\n\nSo, 10(3Q + D) + P = 320\n\nThis suggests that 3Q + D must be less than or equal to 32, because 10 times that plus P equals 320. Wait, let me see:\n\nIf 10(3Q + D) + P = 320, then 10(3Q + D) \u2264 320, because P is non-negative. So, 3Q + D \u2264 32.\n\nTherefore, 3Q + D \u2264 32\n\nSince Q and D are non-negative integers, the maximum Q can be is when D is zero. So, 3Q \u2264 32 \u2192 Q \u2264 32/3 \u2248 10.666. Since Q must be an integer, the maximum Q is 10.\n\nWait, but let me check this because sometimes when you have constraints, the maximum might not always be at the boundary. Let me verify if Q=10 is possible.\n\nIf Q=10, then N=10. So, the value from quarters and nickels is 10*25 + 10*5 = 250 + 50 = 300 cents.\n\nSo, remaining amount is 320 - 300 = 20 cents. That has to come from dimes and pennies. Since D and P are non-negative integers, and the total from them is 20 cents.\n\nSo, D*10 + P*1 = 20\n\nWe need to find non-negative integers D and P such that 10D + P = 20.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n- D=0, P=20\n- D=1, P=10\n- D=2, P=0\n\nSo, yes, Q=10 is possible. Therefore, the maximum number of quarters Sasha could have is 10.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to have more than 10 quarters? Let's see. Suppose Q=11.\n\nThen, N=11. The value from quarters and nickels would be 11*25 + 11*5 = 275 + 55 = 330 cents, which is more than 320. So, that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, Q cannot be 11. So, the maximum possible Q is 10.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When Q=10, the remaining is 20 cents, which can be achieved with 2 dimes and 0 pennies, or 1 dime and 10 pennies, or 0 dimes and 20 pennies. All are valid, so yes, Q=10 is possible.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of quarters Sasha could have is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest number of quarters Sasha could have is \\boxed{10}.\n</think>\n\nSasha has $3.20 in U.S. coins, and she has the same number of quarters and nickels. We need to find the greatest number of quarters she could have.\n\nFirst, we denote the number of quarters as \\( Q \\) and the number of nickels as \\( N \\). Since she has the same number of quarters and nickels, \\( N = Q \\).\n\nThe total value of the coins in cents is given by:\n\\[ Q \\times 25 + Q \\times 5 + D \\times 10 + P \\times 1 = 320 \\]\nwhere \\( D \\) is the number of dimes and \\( P \\) is the number of pennies.\n\nSubstituting \\( N = Q \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 25Q + 5Q + 10D + P = 320 \\]\nSimplifying this:\n\\[ 30Q + 10D + P = 320 \\]\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of \\( Q \\) such that \\( Q \\), \\( D \\), and \\( P \\) are non-negative integers. We can factor out 10 from the equation:\n\\[ 10(3Q + D) + P = 320 \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[ 3Q + D \\leq 32 \\]\n\nTo maximize \\( Q \\), we set \\( D = 0 \\):\n\\[ 3Q \\leq 32 \\]\n\\[ Q \\leq \\frac{32}{3} \\approx 10.666 \\]\n\nSince \\( Q \\) must be an integer, the maximum value is 10. We verify this by checking if \\( Q = 10 \\) leaves enough value for dimes and pennies:\n\\[ 10 \\times 25 + 10 \\times 5 = 250 + 50 = 300 \\]\n\\[ 320 - 300 = 20 \\]\n\nThe remaining 20 cents can be achieved with 2 dimes (0 pennies), 1 dime and 10 pennies, or 0 dimes and 20 pennies, all valid. Thus, \\( Q = 10 \\) is possible.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of quarters Sasha could have is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

If 12 customers buy a toaster that costs $\\$500$, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a toaster that costs $\\$750$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so Daniel says that the popularity of a toaster, measured by the number of sales, is inversely proportional to its cost. Hmm, that means if the cost goes up, the number of sales goes down, and vice versa. I remember that when two things are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. So, if I denote the number of sales as P and the cost as C, then P * C = k, where k is some constant.\n\nAlright, the problem gives me that 12 customers bought a toaster that costs $500. So, plugging into the equation, P is 12 and C is 500. So, 12 * 500 = k. Let me calculate that: 12 times 500 is 6000. So, k is 6000.\n\nNow, the question is, how many customers would buy a toaster that costs $750? So, we need to find the new number of sales, let's call it P_new, when the cost C is $750. Using the same formula, P_new * 750 = 6000. So, to find P_new, I divide both sides by 750. That would be 6000 divided by 750.\n\nLet me do that division. 6000 divided by 750. Well, 750 times 8 is 6000 because 750 times 10 is 7500, which is too much, so 750 times 8 is 6000. So, P_new is 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 750 times 8: 700*8 is 5600, and 50*8 is 400, so 5600+400 is 6000. Yep, that's correct. So, when the cost is $750, the number of sales is 8.\n\nI think that makes sense because the cost is increasing, so the number of sales should decrease. Initially, it was 12, now it's 8. So, the decrease is 4, which is in line with the cost increasing by a factor of 1.5 (since 750 is 1.5 times 500). Since it's inversely proportional, the number of sales should decrease by the same factor, so 12 divided by 1.5 is 8. Yep, that checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe number of customers who buy a toaster is inversely proportional to its cost. Given that 12 customers buy a toaster costing $500, we can find the constant of proportionality, k, as follows:\n\nP * C = k  \n12 * 500 = k  \nk = 6000\n\nFor a toaster costing $750, we use the same constant to find the new number of customers:\n\nP_new * 750 = 6000  \nP_new = 6000 / 750  \nP_new = 8\n\n**Answer:** According to Daniel's theory, 8 customers would buy a toaster costing $750.\n\n\\boxed{8}",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: What is the sum of the even, positive integers less than 62? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the even, positive integers less than 62. Let me break this down step by step. First, I should understand what exactly is being asked. Even positive integers less than 62 means numbers like 2, 4, 6, and so on up to the largest even number that's still less than 62.\n\nWait, what's the largest even number less than 62? Well, 62 is an even number, so the next one down would be 60. So the numbers we're dealing with start at 2 and go up to 60, increasing by 2 each time. That makes an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAlright, now I remember that the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. So I need to figure out how many terms there are in this sequence.\n\nTo find n, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: an = a1 + (n - 1)d, where d is the common difference. Here, a1 is 2, d is 2, and an is 60. Plugging in those values: 60 = 2 + (n - 1)*2. Let me solve for n.\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides: 58 = (n - 1)*2. Then divide both sides by 2: 29 = n - 1. So n = 30. That means there are 30 terms in this sequence.\n\nNow, using the sum formula: S = n/2 * (a1 + an). Plugging in the numbers: S = 30/2 * (2 + 60). Simplify that: 30/2 is 15, and 2 + 60 is 62. So S = 15 * 62.\n\nWait, what's 15 multiplied by 62? Let me calculate that. 15 times 60 is 900, and 15 times 2 is 30, so adding those together gives 930. So the sum should be 930.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify each step. First, I identified the correct numbers: even positive integers less than 62. That's 2, 4, 6, ..., 60. Then I determined it's an arithmetic sequence with a1 = 2, d = 2, an = 60. Calculated n correctly as 30 terms. Applied the sum formula correctly, getting 15 * 62 = 930.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the sum of the first n even numbers. There's a formula for that: n*(n + 1). Wait, no, that's for the sum of the first n natural numbers. Let me think again. The sum of the first n even numbers is indeed n*(n + 1). Let me test that with a small n.\n\nFor example, n = 1: 2 = 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Correct. n = 2: 2 + 4 = 6. Formula: 2*(2 + 1) = 6. Correct. n = 3: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. Formula: 3*(3 + 1) = 12. Correct. So this formula works.\n\nWait, but in our case, the last term is 60, which is the 30th even number. So using the formula for the sum of the first n even numbers, S = n*(n + 1). So S = 30*(30 + 1) = 30*31 = 930. That's the same result as before. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the even, positive integers less than 62 is 930.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the even, positive integers less than 62 is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Identify the sequence: 2, 4, 6, ..., 60 (an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2).\n2. Determine the number of terms (n): Using the nth term formula, 60 = 2 + (n - 1)*2 \u2192 n = 30.\n3. Apply the sum formula: S = n/2 * (a1 + an) = 30/2 * (2 + 60) = 15 * 62 = 930.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{930}",

Problem: A company that sells widgets has to pay $\\$500$ in maintenance fees each day and then it pays each worker $\\$15$ per hour. Each worker makes 5 widgets per hour, which are sold at $\\$3.10$ each. What is the least number of workers the company has to hire in order to make a profit in an 8-hour workday? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the least number of workers a company has to hire to make a profit in an 8-hour workday. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the company has fixed maintenance fees of $500 every day. That's straightforward. Then, they pay each worker $15 per hour. So, if they have 'n' workers, the total daily wage from workers would be 15 * n * 8, because each worker works 8 hours a day. \n\nNext, each worker makes 5 widgets per hour. Since they work 8 hours, each worker makes 5 * 8 = 40 widgets per day. So, if they have 'n' workers, the total number of widgets produced in a day would be 40 * n.\n\nThese widgets are sold at $3.10 each. So, the revenue from selling widgets would be 3.10 * 40 * n. Let me write that down:\n\nRevenue = 3.10 * 40 * n = 124n\n\nNow, the total cost for the company includes two parts: fixed maintenance fees and variable labor costs. The fixed maintenance is $500, and the labor cost is 15 * n * 8 = 120n. So, total cost is:\n\nTotal Cost = 500 + 120n\n\nTo make a profit, the revenue must be greater than the total cost. So, we set up the inequality:\n\n124n > 500 + 120n\n\nLet me solve for 'n'. Subtract 120n from both sides:\n\n124n - 120n > 500\n4n > 500\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nn > 500 / 4\nn > 125\n\nSo, the company needs to hire more than 125 workers to make a profit. Since you can't hire a fraction of a worker, they need to hire at least 126 workers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the revenue: 40 widgets per worker, sold at $3.10 each. So, 40 * 3.10 = 124 per worker. For 'n' workers, it's 124n. That seems correct.\n\nTotal cost: Fixed is $500. Variable labor cost is 15 per hour per worker, 8 hours, so 15*8=120 per worker. For 'n' workers, it's 120n. So, total cost is 500 + 120n. Correct.\n\nSetting up the inequality: 124n > 500 + 120n. Subtract 120n: 4n > 500. So, n > 125. So, n must be 126. That seems right.\n\nI think I did everything correctly. Let me just check if the calculations for revenue and labor cost are accurate.\n\nRevenue: 5 widgets per hour per worker, 8 hours, so 5*8=40 widgets per worker. 40 widgets * $3.10 = $124 per worker. So, yes, 124n.\n\nLabor cost: $15 per hour per worker, 8 hours: 15*8=120 per worker. So, 120n.\n\nTotal cost: 500 + 120n. Correct.\n\nInequality: 124n > 500 + 120n. Subtract 120n: 4n > 500. So, n > 125. So, n must be 126. That's the answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It all adds up correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least number of workers required for the company to make a profit, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Revenue:**\n   - Each worker produces 5 widgets per hour.\n   - Over 8 hours, each worker produces 5 * 8 = 40 widgets.\n   - Each widget is sold at $3.10, so revenue per worker is 40 * 3.10 = $124.\n   - For 'n' workers, total revenue is 124n.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost:**\n   - Fixed maintenance fee: $500.\n   - Labor cost: $15 per hour per worker, 8 hours = 15 * 8 = $120 per worker.\n   - For 'n' workers, total labor cost is 120n.\n   - Total cost is 500 + 120n.\n\n3. **Set Up Profit Inequality:**\n   - Revenue must exceed total cost.\n   - 124n > 500 + 120n.\n\n4. **Solve for 'n':**\n   - Subtract 120n from both sides: 4n > 500.\n   - Divide by 4: n > 125.\n\n5. **Determine Minimum Number of Workers:**\n   - Since 'n' must be an integer greater than 125, the minimum number of workers is 126.\n\n**Answer:** The company must hire at least \\boxed{126} workers.",

Liz, being mathematically inclined, responds by pointing out that there are exactly twice as many people in the English class as there are in the French class. How many people are taking English but not French? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have 25 people taking either English or French, and Liz and Max are talking about it. Max says that they and Max are the only two taking both classes. So, that means there are 2 students who are taking both English and French. \n\nThen, Liz points out that there are exactly twice as many people in the English class as there are in the French class. So, the English class has twice as many students as the French class. \n\nOur goal is to find out how many people are taking English but not French. So, basically, we need to find the number of students in the English class who aren't also taking French.\n\nLet me start by defining some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let E be the number of students taking English.\n- Let F be the number of students taking French.\n- Since there are 25 people taking either English or French, the total number of students is E + F - B, where B is the number of students taking both classes. Wait, actually, the formula for the union of two sets is E + F - B, but in this case, B is 2 because Max and Liz are the only two taking both classes. So, the total number of students is E + F - 2 = 25. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that Liz and Max are the only two taking both classes, so B is 2. So, E + F - 2 = 25. That means E + F = 27. \n\nNow, Liz says that there are exactly twice as many people in the English class as there are in the French class. So, E = 2F. \n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. E + F = 27\n2. E = 2F\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first. So, replacing E with 2F in the first equation:\n\n2F + F = 27\n3F = 27\nF = 9\n\nSo, the number of students taking French is 9. Then, since E = 2F, E = 2 * 9 = 18. \n\nSo, there are 18 students taking English and 9 students taking French. \n\nBut we need to find how many people are taking English but not French. So, that would be the total number of English students minus those taking both. \n\nSo, English only = E - B = 18 - 2 = 16.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The total number of students is E + F - B = 18 + 9 - 2 = 25, which matches the problem statement. \n\nSo, yes, the number of students taking English but not French is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let E be the number of students taking English.\n   - Let F be the number of students taking French.\n   - Let B be the number of students taking both classes.\n\n2. **Given Information:**\n   - Total students taking either English or French: 25.\n   - B = 2 (Max and Liz are the only two taking both classes).\n   - E = 2F (English class has twice as many students as the French class).\n\n3. **Formulate Equations:**\n   - Total students: E + F - B = 25\n   - Substitute E = 2F and B = 2:\n     - 2F + F - 2 = 25\n     - 3F = 27\n     - F = 9\n\n4. **Find E:**\n   - E = 2F = 2 * 9 = 18\n\n5. **Find Students Taking Only English:**\n   - English only = E - B = 18 - 2 = 16\n\n**Answer:** 16 people are taking English but not French.\n\n\\boxed{16}",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many integers fall between $\\sqrt5$ and $\\sqrt{50}$ on a number line? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find how many integers fall between \u221a5 and \u221a50 on a number line. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that to find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller integer from the larger one. But wait, in this case, the numbers aren't integers themselves; they're square roots. So I need to find the approximate values of \u221a5 and \u221a50 first.\n\nStarting with \u221a5. I know that \u221a4 is 2 and \u221a9 is 3, so \u221a5 must be somewhere between 2 and 3. To get a better approximation, I can use a calculator or remember that \u221a5 is approximately 2.236. Let me write that down: \u221a5 \u2248 2.236.\n\nNext, \u221a50. Hmm, I know that \u221a49 is 7 and \u221a64 is 8, so \u221a50 must be between 7 and 8. To get a more precise value, I can note that \u221a50 is the same as \u221a(25*2), which is 5\u221a2. I remember that \u221a2 is approximately 1.414, so 5*1.414 is about 7.07. So \u221a50 \u2248 7.07.\n\nNow that I have both approximate values, \u221a5 \u2248 2.236 and \u221a50 \u2248 7.07, I can determine which integers lie between these two values. The integers greater than 2.236 start from 3, and the integers less than 7.07 go up to 7. So the integers between them would be 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I have a number between a and b, the integers between them would be the smallest integer greater than a and the largest integer less than b. So here, a is approximately 2.236, so the next integer is 3. And b is approximately 7.07, so the integer just below that is 7. So the integers between 2.236 and 7.07 are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nNow, let me count them. Starting from 3: 3 is one, 4 is two, 5 is three, 6 is four, and 7 is five. So that's five integers in total.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I didn't miss any integers. Let me list them out again: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's five numbers. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if 7 is indeed less than \u221a50. Since \u221a50 is approximately 7.07, 7 is just a tiny bit less than that. So 7 is included. Similarly, 3 is just a bit more than \u221a5, so 3 is included as well.\n\nSo, to recap: \u221a5 is about 2.236, \u221a50 is about 7.07. The integers between them are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's five integers.\n\nI think that's it. I can't think of any other integers that might fall between these two square roots. Let me just visualize the number line in my head. \u221a5 is somewhere around 2.236, and \u221a50 is around 7.07. So the distance between them is quite a bit, but the integers in between are straightforward.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. I approximated the square roots correctly and identified the right integers. So, I'm confident that the answer is five integers.\n</think>\n\nThe integers between \u221a5 and \u221a50 are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Therefore, the number of integers in this range is 5.\n\n\\boxed{5}",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If the determinant of matrix A is 2, and the determinant of matrix B is 12, then find the determinant of the product of A and B, which is det(AB).\n\nAlright, so I know that determinants have certain properties, especially when dealing with matrix multiplication. I think one of the key properties is that the determinant of the product of two matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. So, det(AB) should be equal to det(A) multiplied by det(B).\n\nLet me write that down to make it clearer:\n\ndet(AB) = det(A) * det(B)\n\nGiven that det(A) is 2 and det(B) is 12, I can substitute those values into the equation.\n\ndet(AB) = 2 * 12\n\nNow, 2 multiplied by 12 is 24. So, that should be the determinant of AB.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with determinants, especially with larger matrices, the properties might not hold as straightforwardly, but in this case, since we're just dealing with the product of two matrices and their determinants, the property should definitely apply.\n\nAnother thing I remember is that the determinant of a matrix product can be thought of in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrices. If A has eigenvalues \u03bb1, \u03bb2, ..., \u03bbn and B has eigenvalues \u03bc1, \u03bc2, ..., \u03bcn, then AB has eigenvalues \u03bb1\u03bc1, \u03bb2\u03bc2, ..., \u03bbn\u03bcn. Therefore, the determinant of AB, which is the product of its eigenvalues, would be the product of \u03bb1\u03bc1, \u03bb2\u03bc2, etc., which is det(A) * det(B). That matches what I thought earlier.\n\nSo, applying that to our problem, with det(A) = 2 and det(B) = 12, det(AB) should be 2 * 12 = 24. That seems straightforward.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward once you remember the property of determinants with respect to matrix multiplication. It's a good reminder that sometimes in linear algebra, properties like these make solving problems much easier instead of getting bogged down in more complicated calculations.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think of a simple example with smaller matrices. Suppose A is a 2x2 matrix with determinant 2, and B is another 2x2 matrix with determinant 12. Then, AB would be a 2x2 matrix, and its determinant should be 24. Let me create such matrices.\n\nLet's take A as:\n\n[2  0]\n[0  1]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (2)(1) - (0)(0) = 2, which matches the given det(A) = 2.\n\nNow, let's take B as:\n\n[6  0]\n[0  2]\n\nThe determinant of B is (6)(2) - (0)(0) = 12, which matches det(B) = 12.\n\nNow, let's compute AB:\n\n[2*6 + 0*0, 2*0 + 0*2]\n[0*6 + 1*0, 0*0 + 1*2]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n[12, 0]\n[0, 2]\n\nThe determinant of AB is (12)(2) - (0)(0) = 24, which is indeed 2 * 12. So, that checks out.\n\nAnother example with a 3x3 matrix might be too time-consuming, but the principle remains the same. So, I feel confident that the property det(AB) = det(A) * det(B) holds true in general, and thus the solution to the problem is 24.\n</think>\n\nTo find the determinant of the product of matrices A and B, we use the property that the determinant of the product is the product of the determinants. Given det(A) = 2 and det(B) = 12, we calculate:\n\ndet(AB) = det(A) * det(B) = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nThus, the determinant of AB is 24.\n\n\\boxed{24}",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this math problem here: Round 54.\\overline{54} to the nearest hundredth. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to repeating decimals, so I might make some mistakes along the way, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 54.\\overline{54} means. The overline is over the 54, which means that the 54 is repeating infinitely. So, it's like 54.5454545454... and so on. Got it. So, it's a decimal that goes on forever with 54 repeating.\n\nNow, the question is asking me to round this number to the nearest hundredth. I remember that rounding means to approximate a number to a certain degree of accuracy. In this case, the hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal point. So, the hundredth place is the 5 in 54.5454...\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm identifying the correct place. So, the number is 54.5454545454... Let's break it down:\n\n- The first digit after the decimal is 5 (tenths place).\n- The second digit is 4 (hundredths place).\n- The third digit is 5 (thousandths place).\n- The fourth digit is 4 (ten-thousandths place).\n- The fifth digit is 5 (hundred-thousandths place).\n- And so on, with the digits alternating between 5 and 4.\n\nSo, the number is 54.5454545454... and so on. Now, I need to round this to the nearest hundredth. The hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal, which is 4 in this case.\n\nBut wait, the third digit after the decimal is 5, which is the thousandths place. So, when rounding to the nearest hundredth, I need to look at the thousandths place to decide whether to round up or down. If the thousandths place is 5 or higher, I round the hundredths place up by one. If it's less than 5, I leave the hundredths place as it is.\n\nIn this case, the thousandths place is 5, so I should round the hundredths place up by one. The hundredths place is currently 4, so adding one would make it 5. Therefore, the number rounded to the nearest hundredth would be 54.55.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the original number is 54.5454545454... The third digit is 5, so the second digit is 4. Adding one to 4 gives 5. So, yes, the number becomes 54.55 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nBut hold on a second. Is there any chance that rounding could cause a carry-over? For example, if the hundredths place was 9 and I added one, it would become 10. But in this case, it's 4, so adding one is fine without causing a carry-over. So, no problem there.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how much 54.\\overline{54} is. Since it's 54.5454545454..., it's just a bit more than 54.54. So, rounding to the nearest hundredth would give 54.55 because the next digit after 54 is 5, which is the threshold for rounding up.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not confusing hundredths with thousandths. The hundredths place is two decimal places, and the thousandths place is three. So, in this case, since we're rounding to the nearest hundredth, we're looking at the third decimal place to decide whether to round up or down. The third decimal is 5, so we round the second decimal up from 4 to 5, making it 54.55.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 54.55 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n</think>\n\nTo round \\(54.\\overline{54}\\) to the nearest hundredth, we first recognize that \\(54.\\overline{54}\\) is \\(54.5454545454...\\). \n\n1. Identify the hundredth place: The second digit after the decimal is 4.\n2. Look at the next digit (thousandths place): It is 5.\n3. Since the thousandths place is 5, we round up the hundredths place from 4 to 5.\n\nThus, the rounded number to the nearest hundredth is \\(54.55\\).\n\n\\boxed{54.55}",

Problem: A grocer makes a display of cans in which the top row has one can and each lower row has two more cans than the row above it. If the display contains 100 cans, how many rows does it contain? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where a grocer is arranging cans in a display. The top row has one can, and each row below has two more cans than the row above. The total number of cans is 100, and I need to find out how many rows there are. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the number of cans in each row forms an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the difference is 2 cans per row. The first term of this sequence is 1 can (the top row). So, the number of cans in each row goes like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to find the total number of cans when there are n rows. Since each row has an increasing number of cans by 2 each time, the number of cans in the nth row would be 1 + (n-1)*2. Let me write that out:\n\nNumber of cans in nth row = 1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1\n\nSo, for each row, the number of cans is 2n - 1, where n is the row number.\n\nNow, the total number of cans in the display is the sum of this arithmetic sequence from the first row up to the nth row. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nSum = (n/2) * [2a + (n - 1)d]\n\nWhere:\n- n is the number of terms (rows, in this case)\n- a is the first term (number of cans in the first row)\n- d is the common difference (increase in the number of cans per row)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n- a = 1\n- d = 2\n- Sum = 100\n\nSo, substituting these into the formula:\n\n100 = (n/2) * [2*1 + (n - 1)*2]\n\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the expression inside the brackets:\n\n2*1 = 2\n(n - 1)*2 = 2n - 2\n\nAdding these together:\n2 + 2n - 2 = 2n\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n100 = (n/2) * 2n\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(n/2) * 2n = n * n = n\u00b2\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n100 = n\u00b2\n\nTo find n, take the square root of both sides:\n\nn = \u221a100\nn = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 rows in the display.\n\nWait, let me double-check this because sometimes when dealing with sequences, it's easy to make a mistake in the formula.\n\nAnother way to calculate the sum is using the formula:\n\nSum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nIn this case, the number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term is 2n - 1. So:\n\nSum = (n/2) * [1 + (2n - 1)] = (n/2)*(2n) = n\u00b2\n\nWhich matches our previous result. So, since the sum is 100, n\u00b2 = 100, so n = 10. That seems correct.\n\nLet me also list out the number of cans in each row to confirm that the total is indeed 100:\n\nRow 1: 1 can\nRow 2: 3 cans\nRow 3: 5 cans\nRow 4: 7 cans\nRow 5: 9 cans\nRow 6: 11 cans\nRow 7: 13 cans\nRow 8: 15 cans\nRow 9: 17 cans\nRow 10: 19 cans\n\nNow, let's add these up:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n4 + 5 = 9\n9 + 7 = 16\n16 + 9 = 25\n25 + 11 = 36\n36 + 13 = 49\n49 + 15 = 64\n64 + 17 = 81\n81 + 19 = 100\n\nYes, the total is indeed 100 cans when there are 10 rows. So, the answer is 10 rows.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of rows in the display, we recognize that the number of cans in each row forms an arithmetic sequence. The first term \\( a \\) is 1, and the common difference \\( d \\) is 2. The number of cans in the \\( n \\)-th row is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cans in nth row} = 1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1\n\\]\n\nThe total number of cans in \\( n \\) rows is the sum of this arithmetic sequence, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2a + (n - 1)d]\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values \\( a = 1 \\), \\( d = 2 \\), and \\( \\text{Sum} = 100 \\):\n\n\\[\n100 = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2(1) + (n - 1)(2)]\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the brackets:\n\n\\[\n2 + 2(n - 1) = 2 + 2n - 2 = 2n\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n100 = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 2n = n^2\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nn = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are **10 rows** in the display.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this function f(x) that is defined piecewise. It means that depending on the value of x, I use one of two expressions. Specifically, if x is less than 7, I use x squared minus 4, and if x is 7 or greater, I use x minus 13. The problem is asking me to find f(f(f(17))). That sounds like I need to apply the function f three times, starting with the input 17. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me figure out what f(17) is. Since 17 is definitely greater than or equal to 7, I need to use the second part of the function, which is x minus 13. So, substituting 17 into that, I get 17 minus 13, which is 4. So, f(17) is 4. That was straightforward.\n\nNow, the next step is to find f(f(17)), which is f(4). Again, I need to determine whether 4 is less than 7 or not. Since 4 is less than 7, I use the first part of the function, which is x squared minus 4. So, plugging 4 into that, I get 4 squared minus 4, which is 16 minus 4, so that's 12. Therefore, f(4) is 12. So, now I have f(f(17)) equal to 12.\n\nNow, the last step is to find f(f(f(17))), which is f(12). Again, I need to check where 12 falls in relation to 7. Since 12 is greater than 7, I use the second part of the function, which is x minus 13. Substituting 12 into that, I get 12 minus 13, which is -1. So, f(12) is -1. Therefore, f(f(f(17))) is -1.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with f(17): 17 is greater than 7, so 17 minus 13 is indeed 4. Then f(4): 4 is less than 7, so 4 squared is 16, minus 4 is 12. Then f(12): 12 is greater than 7, so 12 minus 13 is -1. That seems correct.\n\nI was a bit confused initially about the piecewise function, thinking maybe I had to apply the function multiple times with different rules, but it turned out that each application was straightforward based on whether the current value was less than 7 or not. So, each time I applied the function, I only needed to check which rule to use based on the current value of x.\n\nSo, in summary, f(f(f(17))) equals -1 after applying the function three times, each time checking if the current value was less than 7 or not. That makes sense, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( f(f(f(17))) \\), we proceed step by step:\n\n1. **First application:** \\( f(17) \\). Since \\( 17 \\geq 7 \\), we use \\( x - 13 \\). Thus, \\( f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Second application:** \\( f(f(17)) = f(4) \\). Since \\( 4 < 7 \\), we use \\( x^2 - 4 \\).

The octahedron is formed by joining the centers of adjoining faces of the cube. Hmm, let me visualize this. A cube has six faces, each face has a center, so connecting these centers should form an octahedron inside the cube. \n\nFirst, I should probably assign a side length to the cube to make the calculations easier. Let's say the cube has a side length of 'a'. Then, the volume of the cube would be \\( a^3 \\). \n\nNow, the centers of the cube's faces are each at a distance of \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\) from the cube's edges. So, if I connect these centers, each edge of the octahedron would be the distance between two centers of adjacent faces of the cube. \n\nWait, how do I find that distance? Let me think. If I take two adjacent faces of the cube, their centers are separated by one edge of the cube. So, for example, if I take the front and right faces of the cube, their centers would be diagonally opposite on the front face and the right face. But actually, the distance between the centers of two adjacent faces would be the distance between two points each \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\) from the cube's edges but on adjacent faces.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of coordinates. Let's place the cube in a 3D coordinate system with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (a,a,a). Then, the centers of the faces would be at (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, a/2, a), (a/2, 0, a/2), (a/2, a, a/2), (0, a/2, a/2), and (a, a/2, a/2). \n\nSo, connecting these centers should form an octahedron. Now, to find the edge length of this octahedron, I can compute the distance between two adjacent centers. Let's take two centers that are adjacent on the cube, say (a/2, a/2, 0) and (a/2, 0, a/2). The distance between these two points would be:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2} - \\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2} - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(0 - \\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2} \\]\n\\[ = \\sqrt{0 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2} \\]\n\\[ = \\sqrt{0 + \\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\]\n\\[ = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nSo, the edge length of the octahedron is \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). Now, I need to find the volume of this regular octahedron. \n\nI recall that the volume of a regular octahedron can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3 \\]\n\nwhere 's' is the edge length of the octahedron. Substituting \\( s = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) into this formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\left( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^3 \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{(\\sqrt{2})^3} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{2^{3/2}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{2^{1} \\cdot 2^{1/2}}} \\]\nWait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute \\( (\\sqrt{2})^3 \\):\n\n\\[ (\\sqrt{2})^3 = (\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot (\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot (\\sqrt{2}) = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot a^3}{3 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{a^3}{6} \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the octahedron is \\( \\frac{a^3}{6} \\). \n\nNow, the volume of the cube is \\( a^3 \\). So, the ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the cube is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\frac{a^3}{6}}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nLooking at the options, that's option C. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. \n\nFirst, I assigned the cube a side length 'a'. Then, the centers of the cube's faces are at \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\) from the edges. Connecting these centers forms an octahedron. The edge length between two centers is \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). \n\nThen, using the volume formula for a regular octahedron, which is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3 \\), substituting \\( s = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), we get:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^3 \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{2^{3/2}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot a^3}{3 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{a^3}{6} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the ratio is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), which is option C.\n</think>\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the regular octahedron to the volume of the cube is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Cube Volume**: Let the side length of the cube be \\( a \\). The volume of the cube is:\n   \\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3 \\]\n\n2. **Octahedron Edge Length**: The edge length of the octahedron is the distance between the centers of two adjacent faces of the cube, which is:\n   \\[ s = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\n3. **Octahedron Volume**: Using the formula for the volume of a regular octahedron:\n   \\[ V_{\\text{octahedron}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\left( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^3 = \\frac{a^3}{6} \\]\n\n4. **Volume Ratio**: The ratio of the octahedron's volume to the cube's volume is:\n   \\[ \\frac{V_{\\text{octahedron}}}{V_{\\text{cube}}} = \\frac{\\frac{a^3}{6}}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}**",

What is the base seven sum of the digits of this product? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this math problem step by step. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem is: The product of the base seven numbers \\(24_7\\) and \\(30_7\\) is expressed in base seven. What is the base seven sum of the digits of this product?\n\nHmm, alright. So, we have two numbers in base seven, \\(24_7\\) and \\(30_7\\), and we need to multiply them, express the result in base seven, and then find the sum of the digits of that product in base seven.\n\nLet me break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, I think I should convert both base seven numbers into base ten (decimal) to make the multiplication easier. Once I have the product in decimal, I can convert it back to base seven. After that, I can find the sum of the digits of this base seven product.\n\nSo, let's start with \\(24_7\\).\n\nIn base seven, the rightmost digit is the units place (\\(7^0\\)), and the next digit is the sevens place (\\(7^1\\)). So, \\(24_7\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\(2 \\times 7^1 + 4 \\times 7^0\\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n\n\\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n\nAdding those together: \\(14 + 4 = 18\\)\n\nSo, \\(24_7\\) is equal to 18 in base ten.\n\nNext, let's convert \\(30_7\\) to base ten.\n\nAgain, using the same method:\n\n\\(3 \\times 7^1 + 0 \\times 7^0\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n\n\\(0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n\nAdding those: \\(21 + 0 = 21\\)\n\nSo, \\(30_7\\) is equal to 21 in base ten.\n\nNow, we can multiply these two base ten numbers: 18 and 21.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n18 multiplied by 21.\n\nHmm, I can think of 21 as 20 + 1, so:\n\n18 \u00d7 20 = 360\n\n18 \u00d7 1 = 18\n\nAdding those together: 360 + 18 = 378\n\nSo, the product in base ten is 378.\n\nNow, I need to convert 378 from base ten to base seven.\n\nTo do this, I can use the division method, where I repeatedly divide the number by 7 and record the remainders.\n\nLet me start:\n\n378 divided by 7.\n\n7 \u00d7 54 = 378, so the remainder is 0.\n\nSo, the first remainder is 0.\n\nNow, take 54 and divide by 7.\n\n7 \u00d7 7 = 49, so 54 - 49 = 5.\n\nRemainder is 5.\n\nNext, take 7 and divide by 7.\n\n7 \u00f7 7 = 1, remainder 0.\n\nNext, take 1 and divide by 7.\n\n1 \u00f7 7 = 0 with remainder 1.\n\nSo, the remainders, starting from the last division, are 1, 0, 5, 0.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right.\n\nWait, actually, when converting from base ten to base seven, you divide the number by 7, take the remainder, then divide the quotient by 7, and so on, until the quotient is zero. The base seven number is the remainders read from last to first.\n\nSo, starting with 378:\n\n378 \u00f7 7 = 54, remainder 0\n\n54 \u00f7 7 = 7, remainder 5\n\n7 \u00f7 7 = 1, remainder 0\n\n1 \u00f7 7 = 0, remainder 1\n\nSo, reading the remainders from last to first: 1, 0, 5, 0.\n\nTherefore, 378 in base ten is 1050 in base seven.\n\nWait, let me check that. So, 1 \u00d7 7^3 + 0 \u00d7 7^2 + 5 \u00d7 7^1 + 0 \u00d7 7^0.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1 \u00d7 343 = 343\n\n0 \u00d7 49 = 0\n\n5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n\n0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n\nAdding them: 343 + 0 + 35 + 0 = 378.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 378 in base ten is 1050 in base seven.\n\nSo, the product of \\(24_7\\) and \\(30_7\\) is \\(1050_7\\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for the base seven sum of the digits of this product.\n\nSo, the digits of \\(1050_7\\) are 1, 0, 5, and 0.\n\nNow, we need to add them together:\n\n1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6\n\nSo, the base seven sum of the digits is 6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the conversion steps.\n\nLet me double-check the base seven to base ten conversion.\n\nFor \\(24_7\\):\n\n2 \u00d7 7 + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18. Correct.\n\nFor \\(30_7\\):\n\n3 \u00d7 7 + 0 = 21 + 0 = 21. Correct.\n\nMultiplying 18 and 21: 18 \u00d7 21.\n\nLet me compute 18 \u00d7 20 = 360, plus 18 \u00d7 1 = 18, totaling 378. Correct.\n\nConverting 378 to base seven:\n\n378 \u00f7 7 = 54, remainder 0\n\n54 \u00f7 7 = 7, remainder 5\n\n7 \u00f7 7 = 1, remainder 0\n\n1 \u00f7 7 = 0, remainder 1\n\nSo, the base seven digits are 1, 0, 5, 0, which is 1050_7.\n\nSum of digits: 1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the steps, so the final answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe product of the base seven numbers \\(24_7\\) and \\(30_7\\) is \\(1050_7\\).

The circles are mutually externally tangent, meaning each circle touches the other two without overlapping. The question is asking for the sum of the areas of these circles.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. The Asymptote code draws three circles with centers at points A, B, and C. The triangle connecting these centers is a 3-4-5 right triangle, which is a well-known Pythagorean triple. So, the sides of the triangle are 3, 4, and 5 units long.\n\nSince the circles are externally tangent, the distance between the centers of any two circles must be equal to the sum of their radii. That's a key point. So, for example, the distance between centers B and C is 5 units, which should be equal to the sum of the radii of circles B and C.\n\nLet me denote the radii of the circles centered at A, B, and C as r_A, r_B, and r_C respectively. Then, based on the distances between the centers, I can write equations:\n\n1. The distance between B and C is 5 units, so r_B + r_C = 5.\n2. The distance between A and C is 4 units, so r_A + r_C = 4.\n3. The distance between A and B is 3 units, so r_A + r_B = 3.\n\nNow, I have a system of three equations with three variables, which I can solve to find the values of r_A, r_B, and r_C. Once I have those, I can compute the areas of each circle using the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2 and then add them all together to get the total sum.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1. r_B + r_C = 5\n2. r_A + r_C = 4\n3. r_A + r_B = 3\n\nI can solve this system step by step. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of another and substitute.\n\nLooking at equation 3: r_A + r_B = 3. I can solve for r_A: r_A = 3 - r_B.\n\nThen, substitute this into equation 2: (3 - r_B) + r_C = 4. Simplify this:\n\n3 - r_B + r_C = 4\n-r_B + r_C = 4 - 3\n-r_B + r_C = 1\nSo, r_C = r_B + 1.\n\nNow, go back to equation 1: r_B + r_C = 5. Substitute r_C from above:\n\nr_B + (r_B + 1) = 5\n2r_B + 1 = 5\n2r_B = 4\nr_B = 2\n\nNow that I have r_B = 2, I can find r_C from earlier: r_C = r_B + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThen, from equation 3: r_A = 3 - r_B = 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nSo, the radii are:\n\nr_A = 1\nr_B = 2\nr_C = 3\n\nLet me check these values against the original equations to make sure they're correct.\n\n1. r_B + r_C = 2 + 3 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. r_A + r_C = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. r_A + r_B = 1 + 2 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll equations are satisfied, so these radii are correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the areas of these circles. The area of a circle is A = \u03c0r\u00b2, so the total area will be:\n\nTotal Area = \u03c0(r_A)\u00b2 + \u03c0(r_B)\u00b2 + \u03c0(r_C)\u00b2\n= \u03c0(1)\u00b2 + \u03c0(2)\u00b2 + \u03c0(3)\u00b2\n= \u03c0(1) + \u03c0(4) + \u03c0(9)\n= \u03c0 + 4\u03c0 + 9\u03c0\n= (1 + 4 + 9)\u03c0\n= 14\u03c0\n\nSo, the sum of the areas of the circles is 14\u03c0.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nCalculating each area:\n\n- Circle A: \u03c0*(1)^2 = \u03c0\n- Circle B: \u03c0*(2)^2 = 4\u03c0\n- Circle C: \u03c0*(3)^2 = 9\u03c0\n\nAdding them together: \u03c0 + 4\u03c0 + 9\u03c0 = 14\u03c0. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. The sum of the areas is 14\u03c0.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the areas of the three circles is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Radius of circle A: \\( r_A = 1 \\)\n2. Radius of circle B: \\( r_B = 2 \\)\n3.

Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this math problem about a carpet and shaded squares. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: There's a square carpet with a side length of 9 feet. It has one large shaded square and eight smaller, congruent shaded squares. There's an Asymptote figure provided, but since I can't visualize it directly, I'll try to imagine based on the description.\n\nThe key information here is that the ratios 9:S and S:T are both equal to 3. Also, S and T are the side lengths of the shaded squares. I need to find the total shaded area.\n\nSo, let's parse this. The carpet is 9x9 feet. There's one large shaded square with side length S and eight smaller shaded squares, each with side length T. The ratios given are 9:S = 3 and S:T = 3.\n\nWait, the ratio 9:S is equal to 3. That means 9:S = 3/1, so S must be 9 divided by 3, which is 3. So S is 3 feet. Similarly, the ratio S:T is 3, so S is 3, so T is S divided by 3, which is 1 foot.\n\nSo, S is 3 feet, and T is 1 foot. Now, I need to find the total shaded area. The shaded areas consist of one large square with side length S (3 feet) and eight smaller squares, each with side length T (1 foot). So, the total shaded area is the area of the large square plus the areas of the eight smaller squares.\n\nLet me calculate that. The area of the large square is S squared, so 3 squared is 9 square feet. Each small square has an area of T squared, which is 1 squared, so 1 square foot. Since there are eight of these, the total area for the small squares is 8 times 1, which is 8 square feet.\n\nSo, adding them together, the total shaded area is 9 + 8, which is 17 square feet. Therefore, the total shaded area is 17 square feet.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. I have the ratios 9:S = 3 and S:T = 3. From 9:S = 3, S = 9/3 = 3. Then from S:T = 3, T = S/3 = 1. So S is 3 and T is 1. Then, the area of the large square is 3^2 = 9, and each small square is 1^2 = 1. There are eight small squares, so 8*1 = 8. Total shaded area is 9 + 8 = 17. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total area of the carpet, which is 9*9 = 81 square feet. If the shaded area is 17, then the unshaded area would be 81 - 17 = 64. Let me check if that makes sense based on the figure.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the figure has multiple shaded squares. The code shows fills for squares at positions (1,1), (4,1), (7,1), (1,4), (3,3), (6,3), (7,4), (1,7), (4,7), (7,7). Each of these squares is either 1x1 or 3x3. For example, the square at (1,1) is 1x1, so area 1. Similarly, the square at (3,3) is 3x3, area 9. The square at (6,3) is 1x1, area 1. So, adding up the shaded squares:\n\n- (1,1): 1\n- (4,1): 1\n- (7,1): 1\n- (1,4): 1\n- (3,3): 9\n- (7,4): 1\n- (1,7): 1\n- (4,7): 1\n- (7,7): 1\n\nSo, that's 8 squares of 1x1, each with area 1, so 8*1 = 8, plus 1 square of 3x3, area 9, totaling 17. So that's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total shaded area is 17 square feet.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a square carpet with a side length of 9 feet. It contains one large shaded square with side length S and eight smaller, congruent shaded squares with side length T. The given ratios are 9:S = 3 and S:T = 3. Additionally, S and T are the side lengths of the shaded squares.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine S:**\n   - Given the ratio 9:S = 3, we can write:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{9}{S} = 3 \\implies S = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine T:**\n   - Given the ratio S:T = 3, and knowing S = 3, we can write:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{S}{T} = 3 \\implies \\frac{3}{T} = 3 \\implies T = 1 \\text{ foot}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the areas:**\n   - The area of the large shaded square (side length S = 3 feet):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{large}} = 3^2 = 9 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n   - The area of each small shaded square (side length T = 1 foot):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{small}} = 1^2 = 1 \\text{ square foot}\n     \\]\n   - There are 8 small shaded squares, so the total area for the small squares:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Area}_{\\text{small}} = 8 \\times 1 = 8 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Sum the areas:**\n   - Total shaded area = Area of large square + Total area of small squares\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Shaded Area} = 9 + 8 = 17 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe total shaded area is \\boxed{17} square feet.",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the greatest integer n such that the quadratic expression n\u00b2 - 11n + 24 is less than or equal to zero. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Since this problem involves finding the range of n where the quadratic is less than or equal to zero, factoring might be a good starting point. \n\nSo, let me try to factor the quadratic n\u00b2 - 11n + 24. I need two numbers that multiply to 24 and add up to -11. Let me think: factors of 24 are 1 and 24, 2 and 12, 3 and 8, 4 and 6. Now, looking for two numbers that add up to 11, but since the middle term is -11n, both numbers should be negative. \n\nLet me see: -3 and -8 multiply to 24 and add up to -11. Perfect! So, the quadratic factors as (n - 3)(n - 8). \n\nSo, the inequality becomes (n - 3)(n - 8) \u2264 0. Now, I need to find the values of n for which this product is less than or equal to zero. \n\nTo solve this, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are where each factor equals zero, which are n = 3 and n = 8. These points divide the number line into three intervals: \n\n1. n < 3\n2. 3 < n < 8\n3. n > 8\n\nNow, I'll test each interval to determine the sign of the product (n - 3)(n - 8) in that interval.\n\n1. For n < 3, let's choose n = 0. Plugging into (0 - 3)(0 - 8) = (-3)(-8) = 24, which is positive.\n2. For 3 < n < 8, let's choose n = 5. Plugging into (5 - 3)(5 - 8) = (2)(-3) = -6, which is negative.\n3. For n > 8, let's choose n = 10. Plugging into (10 - 3)(10 - 8) = (7)(2) = 14, which is positive.\n\nSo, the product is positive when n < 3, negative when 3 < n < 8, and positive again when n > 8. \n\nBut we're looking for where the product is less than or equal to zero, which includes the intervals where it's negative and where it's zero. \n\nThe product is zero when n = 3 or n = 8. So, these are the boundary points where the inequality holds as equality.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the inequality (n - 3)(n - 8) \u2264 0 holds for n between 3 and 8, inclusive. \n\nSince we're asked for the greatest integer n, we need the largest integer in this interval. The interval is from 3 to 8, inclusive, so the largest integer is 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug n = 8 into the original expression: 8\u00b2 - 11*8 + 24 = 64 - 88 + 24 = 0. That works. \n\nAnd n = 3: 3\u00b2 - 11*3 + 24 = 9 - 33 + 24 = 0. That also works. \n\nAnd let's pick a number just below 3, like 2: 2\u00b2 - 11*2 + 24 = 4 - 22 + 24 = 6, which is positive. \n\nAnd a number just above 8, like 9: 9\u00b2 - 11*9 + 24 = 81 - 99 + 24 = 6, which is positive. \n\nSo, the expression is negative between 3 and 8, and zero at 3 and 8. \n\nTherefore, the greatest integer n for which the expression is less than or equal to zero is indeed 8.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0 \\) is \\( \\boxed{8} \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Factor the Quadratic Inequality:**\n   The quadratic expression \\( n^2 - 11n + 24 \\) factors into \\( (n - 3)(n - 8) \\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Inequality:**\n   The inequality becomes \\( (n - 3)(n - 8) \\leq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Critical Points:**\n   The critical points are \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n4. **Create Intervals and Test Each:**\n   - For \\( n < 3 \\), the product is positive.\n   - For \\( 3 < n < 8 \\), the product is negative.\n   - For \\( n > 8 \\), the product is positive.\n\n5. **Identify Where the Inequality Holds:**\n   The inequality holds for \\( 3 \\leq n \\leq 8 \\).\n\n6. **Find the Greatest Integer in the Interval:**\n   The greatest integer \\( n \\) in the interval \\( [3, 8] \\) is \\( 8 \\).\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   Plugging \\( n = 8 \\) into the original expression confirms it equals zero.\n\n**Answer:** \\( \\boxed{8} \\)",

What is the value of $8 \\odot 6$? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the value of 8 \u2299 6 using the operation defined as a \u2299 b = a + (3a)/(2b). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst off, let me make sure I understand the operation correctly. The symbol \u2299 is used here to denote a specific operation that takes two numbers, a and b, and combines them in a particular way. The formula given is a + (3a)/(2b). So, essentially, for any two numbers a and b, I need to compute a plus (3a divided by 2b). That makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the value of 8 \u2299 6. So, plugging in a = 8 and b = 6 into the formula, I should compute 8 + (3*8)/(2*6). Let me write that out to keep track: 8 + (24)/(12). Because 3 times 8 is 24, and 2 times 6 is 12. \n\nSimplifying that, 24 divided by 12 is 2. So now the expression becomes 8 + 2. Adding those together gives me 10. So, 8 \u2299 6 equals 10. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with fractions and operations, it's easy to slip up. So, starting again: a is 8, b is 6. The formula is a + (3a)/(2b). Plugging in the numbers: 8 + (3*8)/(2*6). Calculating the numerator: 3*8 is 24. The denominator: 2*6 is 12. So, now I have 8 + (24/12). 24 divided by 12 is indeed 2. So, 8 + 2 is 10. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI was also thinking about whether there's another way to approach this problem, maybe simplifying the formula before plugging in the numbers. Let me see if that's possible. The formula is a + (3a)/(2b). I can factor out an 'a' from both terms, which would give me a*(1 + 3/(2b)). That might be a cleaner way to handle it, especially if I'm doing it mentally or quickly.\n\nSo, factoring out 'a', we have a*(1 + 3/(2b)). Let's plug in a = 8 and b = 6. That gives us 8*(1 + 3/(2*6)). Calculating the denominator inside the parentheses: 2*6 is 12. So, now we have 8*(1 + 3/12). Simplifying 3/12 gives 0.25. So, 1 + 0.25 is 1.25. Therefore, the expression becomes 8*1.25. \n\nMultiplying 8 by 1.25: Well, 8 times 1 is 8, and 8 times 0.25 is 2. So, adding those together gives 10. That's the same result as before, so it seems consistent.\n\nAnother approach might be to combine the terms before plugging in the numbers. Let me try that. The original formula is a + (3a)/(2b). I can write this as a*(1 + 3/(2b)). As I did before, that simplifies to a*(1 + 3/(2b)). Plugging in a=8 and b=6 gives 8*(1 + 3/12) which is 8*(1 + 0.25) = 8*1.25 = 10. So, again, same answer.\n\nI also wonder if there's a way to represent this operation in a more simplified form, perhaps as a single fraction. Let's see: a + (3a)/(2b). To combine these, I can write them with a common denominator. The first term is a, which can be written as (a*2b)/(2b). The second term is already (3a)/(2b). So, combining them gives (2ab + 3a)/(2b). \n\nFactoring out an 'a' from the numerator: a*(2b + 3)/(2b). So, the operation a \u2299 b is equivalent to a*(2b + 3)/(2b). Let me test this with a=8 and b=6. Plugging in: 8*(2*6 + 3)/(2*6) = 8*(12 + 3)/12 = 8*15/12. Simplifying 15/12 gives 1.25, so 8*1.25 is 10. That matches the previous results.\n\nSo, now I'm pretty confident that 8 \u2299 6 equals 10. I've approached the problem in multiple ways: directly substituting into the formula, factoring out common terms, and simplifying the expression. All methods lead to the same conclusion. \n\nJust to make sure I haven't overlooked any potential errors, let me re-examine the steps. Starting with a=8 and b=6, plugging into the formula: 8 + (3*8)/(2*6) = 8 + 24/12 = 8 + 2 = 10. Correct. Alternatively, factoring out 'a' gives the same result. Simplifying the expression as a single fraction also leads to the same answer. \n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all methods converge to the same solution. So, I'm confident that the value of 8 \u2299 6 is indeed 10.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\(8 \\odot 6\\), we use the operation defined as \\(a \\odot b = a + \\frac{3a}{2b}\\).\n\n1. Substitute \\(a = 8\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n   \\[\n   8 \\odot 6 = 8 + \\frac{3 \\times 8}{2 \\times 6}\n   \\]\n\n2.

Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47? Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47. So, if I have a number 'n' and I divide 47 by 'n', the remainder is 5. That means 47 divided by 'n' gives a quotient and a remainder of 5. In mathematical terms, this can be written as:\n\n47 = n * q + 5\n\nwhere 'q' is the quotient. Now, since the remainder is 5, it must be less than the divisor 'n'. So, 5 < n. That's an important point.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for 'n'. Subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n47 - 5 = n * q\n42 = n * q\n\nSo, 'n' times 'q' equals 42. Now, 'n' and 'q' are both positive integers because they are counting numbers. So, I need to find all pairs of positive integers (n, q) such that n * q = 42 and n > 5 (since 5 < n).\n\nLet me list out all the positive integer factors of 42 and see which ones are greater than 5. The factors of 42 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\nNow, from these, the factors greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. So, these are the possible values for 'n' that satisfy the condition.\n\nNow, let's verify each of these 'n's to make sure they indeed leave a remainder of 5 when dividing into 47.\n\nStarting with n = 6:\n\n47 divided by 6 is 7 with a remainder of 5.

Correct.\n\nn = 14:\n\n47 divided by 14 is 3 with a remainder of 5. 14*3=42, 47-42=5. Correct.\n\nn = 21:\n\n47 divided by 21 is 2 with a remainder of 5. 21*2=42, 47-42=5.

Therefore, there are 5 different counting numbers that will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss any factors. The factors of 42 are indeed 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. So, no, I didn't miss any. All the factors greater than 5 are accounted for.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, we start by setting up the equation based on the division with remainder:\n\n47 = n * q + 5\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the divisor and \\( q \\) is the quotient. Rearranging the equation gives:\n\n42 = n * q\n\nWe need to find all pairs of positive integers \\( (n, q) \\) such that \\( n * q = 42 \\) and \\( n > 5 \\) (since the remainder 5 must be less than the divisor \\( n \\)).\n\nThe factors of 42 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\nThe factors greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. Each of these values for \\( n \\) satisfies the condition that dividing 47 by \\( n \\) leaves a remainder of 5.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 different counting numbers that will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.\n\n\\boxed{5}",

Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the value of n that satisfies the equation. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. The equation is:\n\n(1)/(n + 1) + (2)/(n + 1) + (n)/(n + 1) = 3.\n\nHmm, okay. So all the terms on the left side have the same denominator, which is (n + 1). That might make things easier because I can combine all the numerators together over the common denominator. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the left side as a single fraction. The numerators are 1, 2, and n, so adding them together gives me (1 + 2 + n). So the equation becomes:\n\n(1 + 2 + n)/(n + 1) = 3.\n\nSimplifying the numerator, 1 + 2 is 3, so now we have:\n\n(3 + n)/(n + 1) = 3.\n\nOkay, so now I have a single fraction equal to 3. To solve for n, I can cross-multiply. That means multiplying both sides by (n + 1) to get rid of the denominator. Let's do that.\n\nMultiplying both sides by (n + 1) gives:\n\n3 + n = 3(n + 1).\n\nNow, I'll expand the right side. 3 times (n + 1) is 3n + 3. So the equation becomes:\n\n3 + n = 3n + 3.\n\nHmm, now I need to get all the terms involving n on one side and the constants on the other side. Let me subtract n from both sides to move it to the right side.\n\nSubtracting n from both sides:\n\n3 = 2n + 3.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps again. I have:\n\n3 + n = 3n + 3.\n\nSubtract n from both sides:\n\n3 = 2n + 3.\n\nWait, that's correct. So now, I can subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with n.\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides:\n\n0 = 2n.\n\nSo, 2n equals 0. Dividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nn = 0.\n\nOkay, so n is 0.

So, n = 0 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier, let me go through the steps again.\n\nStarting equation:\n\n(1)/(n + 1) + (2)/(n + 1) + (n)/(n + 1) = 3.\n\nCombine numerators over common denominator:\n\n(1 + 2 + n)/(n + 1) = 3.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(3 + n)/(n + 1) = 3.\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n3 + n = 3(n + 1).\n\nExpand right side:\n\n3 + n = 3n + 3.\n\nSubtract n:\n\n3 = 2n + 3.\n\nSubtract 3:\n\n0 = 2n.\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nn = 0.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

Problem: What is the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form $2002m + 44444n$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form 2002m + 44444n, where m and n are integers. Hmm, this looks like a problem involving linear combinations. I remember that the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as a linear combination of two numbers is their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, maybe I should start by finding the GCD of 2002 and 44444.\n\nLet me write down the two numbers: 2002 and 44444. To find their GCD, I can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then replacing the larger number with the smaller one and the smaller number with the remainder from the division. I repeat this process until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, first step: divide 44444 by 2002. Let me calculate that. 2002 goes into 44444 how many times? Let me do the division: 44444 \u00f7 2002. Hmm, 2002 times 22 is 44,044. Because 2002 * 20 = 40,040, and 2002 * 2 = 4,004, so 40,040 + 4,004 = 44,044. Then, 44,444 - 44,044 is 400. So, 44444 \u00f7 2002 is 22 with a remainder of 400. So, now I have to find GCD(2002, 400).\n\nNext step: divide 2002 by 400. 400 goes into 2002 how many times? Let's see: 400 * 5 = 2000, so 5 times with a remainder of 2. So, now we have GCD(400, 2).\n\nDivide 400 by 2: 2 goes into 400 exactly 200 times with no remainder. So, GCD(2, 0) is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 2002 and 44444 is 2.\n\nWait, so does that mean the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as 2002m + 44444n is 2? Because the GCD is 2, and the smallest positive integer in the set of all such linear combinations is the GCD itself. So, yeah, the answer should be 2.\n\nLet me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the GCD of 2002 and 44444 using the Euclidean algorithm. I divided 44444 by 2002, which gave me a quotient of 22 and a remainder of 400. Then, I took GCD(2002, 400). Divided 2002 by 400, got a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 2. Then, GCD(400, 2), which is 2. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the linear combination. If I can find integers m and n such that 2002m + 44444n = 2, then that would confirm that 2 is the smallest positive integer. Let me try to find such m and n.\n\nStarting from the last step of the Euclidean algorithm: 2 = 2002 - 400 * 5. But 400 is from 44444 - 2002 * 22. So, substituting that in, we get 2 = 2002 - (44444 - 2002 * 22) * 5. Let me expand that: 2 = 2002 - 44444 * 5 + 2002 * 110. Combining like terms: 2002 * (1 + 110) - 44444 * 5. So, 2 = 2002 * 111 - 44444 * 5.\n\nTherefore, m is 111 and n is -5. Plugging those into the equation: 2002*111 + 44444*(-5) = 2002*111 - 44444*5 = 2. So, yes, that works. Therefore, the smallest positive integer is indeed 2.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest positive integer that can be written in the form \\(2002m + 44444n\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers, is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2002 and 44444, which is 2.

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this trapezoid problem to solve. Let me try to visualize it first. In trapezoid ABCD, sides AB and CD are parallel. That means AB is one base, and CD is the other base. The other sides are AD and BC. \n\nThe problem states that angle A is twice angle D. So, if I let angle D be some measure, angle A would be double that. Similarly, angle C is three times angle B. So, angle C is a larger angle compared to angle B.\n\nSince AB and CD are parallel, the consecutive angles between them should be supplementary. That is, angle A and angle D should add up to 180 degrees because they are on the same side of the transversal. Similarly, angle B and angle C should add up to 180 degrees.\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, in a trapezoid, each pair of adjacent angles on the same base are supplementary. So, that means angle A and angle D are supplementary, and angle B and angle C are supplementary. That makes sense because the bases are parallel, so the angles adjacent to each other should add up to 180 degrees.\n\nSo, let me note that down:\n\n- Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0\n- Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0\n\nGiven that angle A = 2 angle D, I can write angle A as 2x and angle D as x, where x is some angle measure. Similarly, angle C is three times angle B, so I can write angle C as 3y and angle B as y, where y is another angle measure.\n\nNow, substituting these into the supplementary angle equations:\n\n1. Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0\n   2x + x = 180\u00b0\n   3x = 180\u00b0\n   x = 60\u00b0\n\nSo, angle D is 60\u00b0, and angle A is 2x, which is 120\u00b0. That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me check the other pair of angles to make sure everything adds up correctly.\n\n2. Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0\n   y + 3y = 180\u00b0\n   4y = 180\u00b0\n   y = 45\u00b0\n\nSo, angle B is 45\u00b0, and angle C is 3y, which is 135\u00b0. Let me verify if all the angles in the trapezoid add up to 360\u00b0, as the sum of interior angles in any quadrilateral is 360\u00b0.\n\nSum of angles:\n\nAngle A = 120\u00b0\nAngle D = 60\u00b0\nAngle B = 45\u00b0\nAngle C = 135\u00b0\n\nAdding them up: 120 + 60 + 45 + 135 = 360\u00b0, which checks out.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the supplementary angles. Sometimes, I get confused whether the angles are on the same side or not. But in a trapezoid, the consecutive angles along each base should be supplementary.\n\nSo, for example, angle A and angle D are on the same base, so they should be supplementary. Similarly, angle B and angle C are on the same base, so they should be supplementary. That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my solution is solid. Angle A is 120\u00b0, angle D is 60\u00b0, angle B is 45\u00b0, and angle C is 135\u00b0, which all add up to 360\u00b0, and the supplementary conditions are satisfied.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It all seems to line up correctly. So, I'm confident that angle A is 120 degrees.\n</think>\n\nThe measure of angle A is 120 degrees.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Given Information:**\n   - In trapezoid ABCD, sides AB and CD are parallel.\n   - Angle A = 2 \u00d7 Angle D.\n   - Angle C = 3 \u00d7 Angle B.\n\n2. **Use the Property of Trapezoids:**\n   - Consecutive angles between the non-parallel sides are supplementary.\n   - Therefore, Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0.\n   - Similarly, Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0.\n\n3. **Let Variables Represent the Angles:**\n   - Let Angle D = x, so Angle A = 2x.\n   - Let Angle B = y, so Angle C = 3y.\n\n4. **Set Up Equations Based on Supplementary Angles:**\n   - From Angle A + Angle D = 180\u00b0:\n     2x + x = 180\u00b0\n     3x = 180\u00b0\n     x = 60\u00b0\n     Therefore, Angle D = 60\u00b0, Angle A = 120\u00b0.\n\n   - From Angle B + Angle C = 180\u00b0:\n     y + 3y = 180\u00b0\n     4y = 180\u00b0\n     y = 45\u00b0\n     Therefore, Angle B = 45\u00b0, Angle C = 135\u00b0.\n\n5. **Verify the Sum of All Angles:**\n   - 120\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 45\u00b0 + 135\u00b0 = 360\u00b0, which is correct for a quadrilateral.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAngle A measures 120 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this equation: floor(r) + r = 12.2. Hmm, let me think about what floor(r) means. It's the greatest integer less than or equal to r. So, if r is, say, 5.7, then floor(r) would be 5. If r is exactly 5, then floor(r) is also 5. \n\nSo, the equation is floor(r) + r = 12.2. Let me denote floor(r) as n, where n is an integer. So, n + r = 12.2. That means r = 12.2 - n. But since n is the floor of r, n \u2264 r < n + 1. \n\nSo, substituting r = 12.2 - n into the inequality n \u2264 r < n + 1, we get n \u2264 12.2 - n < n + 1. Let me solve this step by step. \n\nFirst, the left inequality: n \u2264 12.2 - n. Adding n to both sides gives 2n \u2264 12.2. Dividing both sides by 2, n \u2264 6.1. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 6. \n\nNow, the right inequality: 12.2 - n < n + 1. Let me bring all terms to one side. Subtract n from both sides: 12.2 - 2n < 1. Then, subtract 12.2 from both sides: -2n < -11.2. Dividing both sides by -2 (and remembering to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number), we get n > 5.6. \n\nSince n is an integer, n > 5.6 implies n \u2265 6. \n\nSo, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy 6 \u2264 n \u2264 6. Therefore, n = 6. \n\nNow, substituting back, r = 12.2 - n = 12.2 - 6 = 6.2. \n\nWait, but let me check if this satisfies the original equation. Let's compute floor(r) + r. If r = 6.2, then floor(r) is 6. So, 6 + 6.2 = 12.2, which matches the equation. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider whether n could be another integer. Let me test n = 5. If n = 5, then r = 12.2 - 5 = 7.2. Then, floor(r) is 7, so 7 + 7.2 = 14.2, which is not equal to 12.2. So, that doesn't work. \n\nWhat about n = 7? Then r = 12.2 - 7 = 5.2. Then, floor(r) is 5, so 5 + 5.2 = 10.2, which is not 12.2. So, that's not it either. \n\nWait, so n must be exactly 6, giving r = 6.2. Let me check another value just to be sure. Suppose n = 6, r = 6.2. floor(6.2) is 6, so 6 + 6.2 = 12.2. Perfect. \n\nSo, the only solution is r = 6.2. \n\nI think that's it.

Let me see if that's possible.\n\nI know that 6 is 2 times 3, but maybe that's not helpful here. Let me think about sqrt(6). That's 6^(1/2), right? So, sqrt(6) can be written as 6^(1/2). So, the base of the logarithm is 6^(1/2).\n\nNow, the argument is 216 times sqrt(6). Let me see if I can express 216 in terms of powers of 6. I remember that 6^3 is 216 because 6*6=36, 36*6=216. So, 6^3 = 216. Therefore, 216 is 6^3, and sqrt(6) is 6^(1/2). So, when I multiply them together, 216*sqrt(6) is 6^3 * 6^(1/2).\n\nI remember that when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, 6^3 * 6^(1/2) = 6^(3 + 1/2). Let me calculate 3 + 1/2. That's 3.5 or 7/2. So, 216*sqrt(6) is 6^(7/2).\n\nSo now, the problem is log_{\u221a6}(6^(7/2)). Let me write that again: log_{\u221a6}(6^(7/2)).\n\nI think I can use the property that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So, if I let log_{\u221a6}(6^(7/2)) = x, then (\u221a6)^x = 6^(7/2).\n\nI need to solve for x here. Let me express (\u221a6)^x as (6^(1/2))^x. Which is equal to 6^(x/2). So, 6^(x/2) = 6^(7/2).\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So, x/2 = 7/2. Solving for x, multiply both sides by 2: x = 7.\n\nSo, the value of log_{\u221a6}(216\u221a6) is 7.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let's go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, express sqrt(6) as 6^(1/2). Then, express 216*sqrt(6) as 6^3 * 6^(1/2). Adding exponents, 6^(3 + 1/2) = 6^(7/2). So, the argument is 6^(7/2).\n\nNow, the logarithm is log_{6^(1/2)}(6^(7/2)). Let me use the change of base formula. Alternatively, I can use the property that log_{b^c}(a^d) = (d/c) * log_b(a). But since b is 6^(1/2) and a is 6, maybe it's easier to express it as (d/c) * log_{6}(6^(1/2)).\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since the base is 6^(1/2), and the argument is 6^(7/2), I can write the logarithm as (7/2) divided by (1/2), because the exponent in the argument is 7/2 and the exponent in the base is 1/2.\n\nSo, (7/2) / (1/2) = (7/2) * (2/1) = 7. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula log_{b^c}(a^d) = (d/c) * log_b(a). Since b is 6^(1/2), and a is 6, log_b(a) is log_{6^(1/2)}(6). Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the change of base formula again, log_{6^(1/2)}(6) = (log_6 6) / (log_6 6^(1/2)). Log_6 6 is 1, and log_6 6^(1/2) is (1/2). So, that's 1 / (1/2) = 2.\n\nSo, log_b(a) = 2. Then, (d/c) * log_b(a) = (7/2) * 2 = 7. So, that's another way to get 7.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 7.\n</think>\n\nThe value of log_{\u221a6}(216\u221a6) is 7.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Express the argument in terms of powers of 6:**\n   - 216 = 6\u00b3\n   - \u221a6 = 6^(1/2)\n   - Therefore, 216\u221a6 = 6\u00b3 * 6^(1/2) = 6^(3 + 1/2) = 6^(7/2)\n\n2. **Set up the logarithm with the simplified argument:**\n   - log_{\u221a6}(6^(7/2))\n\n3. **Use the property of logarithms:**\n   - log_{b^c}(a^d) = (d/c) * log_b(a)\n   - Here, b = \u221a6 = 6^(1/2), a = 6, c = 2, d = 7/2\n   - So, log_{6^(1/2)}(6^(7/2)) = (7/2) / (1/2) = 7\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{7}",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have two positive integers, a and b. We're told about their greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm), and how many distinct prime factors each of these has. Specifically, the gcd is divisible by exactly 7 distinct primes, and the lcm is divisible by exactly 28 distinct primes. \n\nWe need to find out how many distinct prime factors a has, given that a has fewer distinct prime factors than b. And the question is asking, if a has fewer distinct primes than b, then a has at most how many distinct prime factors?\n\nHmm. Let me think about this. So, I remember that for any two positive integers a and b, the number of distinct prime factors of their gcd times the number of distinct prime factors of their lcm equals the total number of distinct prime factors of a times the total number of distinct prime factors of b. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Actually, the formula is that the number of distinct prime factors of gcd(a,b) plus the number of distinct prime factors of lcm(a,b) equals the number of distinct prime factors of a plus the number of distinct prime factors of b. Is that correct? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, let me think again. So, the gcd(a,b) is the product of the primes that are common to both a and b, each raised to the minimum of their exponents in a and b. So, the number of distinct primes in gcd(a,b) is the number of primes that are common to both a and b. \n\nOn the other hand, the lcm(a,b) is the product of the primes that are in either a or b, each raised to the maximum of their exponents in a and b. So, the number of distinct primes in lcm(a,b) is the number of primes that are in a or b.\n\nSo, if I consider the total number of distinct primes in a and b together, that would be the number of primes in a plus the number of primes in b minus the number of primes common to both a and b. Wait, but that's not exactly what I'm trying to do here.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is that the number of distinct primes in gcd(a,b) plus the number of distinct primes in lcm(a,b) equals the number of distinct primes in a plus the number of distinct primes in b. Let me verify that.\n\nSuppose that a has m distinct primes and b has n distinct primes. Then, the number of distinct primes in gcd(a,b) is the number of primes common to both a and b. Let's call that k. Then, the number of distinct primes in lcm(a,b) is m + n - k, since it's all primes in a and b, minus the ones that are common.\n\nSo, according to the formula, the number of primes in gcd(a,b) plus the number of primes in lcm(a,b) should equal m + n. Let's check:\n\ngcd(a,b) has k primes, lcm(a,b) has m + n - k primes. So, total is k + (m + n - k) = m + n. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nk + (m + n - k) = m + n\n\nWhich simplifies to m + n = m + n, which is always true. So, that formula holds.\n\nNow, in our problem, we're given that gcd(a,b) is divisible by exactly 7 distinct primes, so k = 7. And the lcm(a,b) is divisible by exactly 28 distinct primes, so m + n - k = 28.\n\nWe also know that a has fewer distinct prime factors than b, so m < n. And we need to find the maximum possible value of m.\n\nSo, let's write down the equations:\n\nk = 7\n\nm + n - k = 28\n\nSo, plugging k = 7 into the second equation:\n\nm + n - 7 = 28\n\nSo, m + n = 35.\n\nWe also know that m < n, and we need to find the maximum possible m.\n\nSo, since m < n, and m + n = 35, we can write n = 35 - m.\n\nAnd since m < n, m < 35 - m.\n\nSo, m < 35 - m\n\nAdding m to both sides:\n\n2m < 35\n\nSo, m < 17.5\n\nSince m is an integer, m \u2264 17.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value of m is 17.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf m = 17, then n = 35 - 17 = 18.\n\nSo, m = 17 < n = 18, which satisfies the condition.\n\nIf m = 18, then n = 17, which violates m < n.\n\nSo, m = 17 is the maximum possible value.\n\nSo, the answer is 17.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nGiven that gcd(a,b) has 7 primes, so k =7.\n\nlcm(a,b) has 28 primes, so m + n -7 =28, leading to m + n=35.\n\nGiven m <n, find max m.\n\nSince m <n and m +n=35,\n\nthen m <35 -m,\n\nso 2m <35,\n\nm <17.5,\n\nso m=17 is the max.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{17}\n</think>\n\nGiven two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is divisible by exactly 7 distinct primes, and their least common multiple (lcm) is divisible by exactly 28 distinct primes.

Problem: Alice buys three burgers and two sodas for $\\$3.20$, and Bill buys two burgers and a soda for $\\$2.00$. How many cents does a burger cost? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about Alice and Bill buying burgers and sodas. I need to figure out how much a burger costs in cents. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given. Alice buys three burgers and two sodas for $3.20. So, that's 3 burgers and 2 sodas. I'll represent the cost of a burger as B and the cost of a soda as S. So, in equation form, that's:\n\n3B + 2S = 3.20\n\nThen, Bill buys two burgers and one soda for $2.00. So, that's 2B + 1S. So, the equation is:\n\n2B + S = 2.00\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be easier here because the coefficients are manageable.\n\nLet me write down the two equations again:\n\n1) 3B + 2S = 3.20\n\n2) 2B + S = 2.00\n\nI can try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's see. If I multiply the second equation by 2, the coefficient of S will be 2, which is the same as in the first equation. That way, I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate S.\n\nSo, multiplying equation 2 by 2:\n\n2*(2B + S) = 2*2.00\n\nWhich gives:\n\n4B + 2S = 4.00\n\nNow, I'll have:\n\nEquation 1: 3B + 2S = 3.20\n\nEquation 3 (after multiplying): 4B + 2S = 4.00\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 from equation 3 to eliminate S.\n\n(4B + 2S) - (3B + 2S) = 4.00 - 3.20\n\nSo, 4B - 3B + 2S - 2S = 0.80\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nB = 0.80\n\nSo, the cost of a burger is $0.80. But the question asks for the cost in cents. Since $1 is 100 cents, $0.80 is 80 cents.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to slip up with decimals.\n\nStarting again:\n\nEquation 1: 3B + 2S = 3.20\n\nEquation 2: 2B + S = 2.00\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2:\n\n4B + 2S = 4.00\n\nSubtract equation 1 from this:\n\n(4B + 2S) - (3B + 2S) = 4.00 - 3.20\n\nWhich gives:\n\nB = 0.80\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, $0.80 is 80 cents. Therefore, a burger costs 80 cents.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me verify by plugging the values back into the original equations to ensure they hold true.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of a soda. From equation 2:\n\n2B + S = 2.00\n\nWe know B = 0.80, so:\n\n2*0.80 + S = 2.00\n\n1.60 + S = 2.00\n\nSubtract 1.60 from both sides:\n\nS = 0.40\n\nSo, a soda costs $0.40.\n\nNow, let's check equation 1:\n\n3B + 2S = 3.20\n\nSubstitute B = 0.80 and S = 0.40:\n\n3*0.80 + 2*0.40 = ?\n\n2.40 + 0.80 = 3.20\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAnd equation 2:\n\n2B + S = 2.00\n\n2*0.80 + 0.40 = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, everything adds up.

Problem: If Heidi can paint a wall in 45 minutes, what fractional part of the wall can she paint in 9 minutes? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so Heidi can paint a whole wall in 45 minutes. The question is asking what fractional part of the wall she can paint in 9 minutes. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that if she paints the entire wall in 45 minutes, then in one minute, she would paint 1/45 of the wall. That makes sense because if you divide the whole wall into 45 equal parts, each part is 1/45 of the wall. So, in one minute, she paints 1/45.\n\nNow, the problem is asking about 9 minutes. So, I need to find out how much of the wall she can paint in 9 minutes. Since she paints 1/45 of the wall in one minute, in 9 minutes, she would paint 9 times that amount. That means I need to multiply 1/45 by 9.\n\nLet me write that down: (1/45) * 9. When I multiply a fraction by a whole number, I can multiply the numerator by that whole number and keep the denominator the same. So, 1 times 9 is 9, and the denominator remains 45. That gives me 9/45.\n\nBut 9/45 can be simplified further because both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 9. Dividing both by 9, I get 1/5. So, Heidi can paint 1/5 of the wall in 9 minutes.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If she paints 1/45 per minute, then in 9 minutes, it's 9*(1/45) = 9/45, which simplifies to 1/5. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using proportions. If 45 minutes corresponds to 1 whole wall, then 9 minutes corresponds to some fraction x. So, 45 minutes corresponds to 1, and 9 minutes corresponds to x. Therefore, x = (9/45) * 1 = 1/5. Yep, same result.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 1/5 of the wall.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the fractional part of the wall Heidi can paint in 9 minutes, given that she can paint the entire wall in 45 minutes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Heidi's painting rate per minute:**\n   - Heidi paints the entire wall in 45 minutes.\n   - Therefore, her painting rate is \\( \\frac{1}{45} \\) of the wall per minute.\n\n2. **Calculate the amount Heidi paints in 9 minutes:**\n   - Multiply Heidi's painting rate by the time she spends painting:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{45} \\times 9 = \\frac{9}{45}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 9:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{45} = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}\n\\]",

It has two different expressions depending on whether x is less than or equal to 1, or greater than 1. So, to find where f(x) equals zero, I need to consider both cases separately.\n\nLet me start with the first case: when x \u2264 1, f(x) = -x - 3. I need to solve for x in this equation when f(x) = 0. So, setting -x - 3 equal to 0:\n\n-x - 3 = 0\n\nLet me solve for x. I can add x to both sides:\n\n-3 = x\n\nWait, that would mean x = -3. Hmm, but I need to check if this solution is valid within the domain of this case, which is x \u2264 1. Since -3 is less than 1, this solution is valid for this case.\n\nSo, one solution is x = -3.\n\nNow, moving on to the second case: when x > 1, f(x) = (x)/2 + 1. I need to solve for x in this equation when f(x) = 0.\n\nSo, setting (x)/2 + 1 equal to 0:\n\n(x)/2 + 1 = 0\n\nLet me solve for x. I can subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n(x)/2 = -1\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 2:\n\nx = -2\n\nWait, but this solution is x = -2, which is less than 1. But in this case, the domain is x > 1, so x = -2 is not in the domain of this case. Therefore, this solution is not valid for this case.\n\nSo, in the second case, there is no solution because the solution x = -2 does not satisfy the condition x > 1.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = -3.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to find the sum of all values of x such that f(x) = 0. Since there is only one solution, x = -3, the sum is just -3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the first case: f(x) = -x - 3. Setting this equal to zero:\n\n-x - 3 = 0\n\nAdding x to both sides:\n\n-3 = x\n\nSo, x = -3. Since -3 \u2264 1, this is a valid solution.\n\nSecond case: f(x) = (x)/2 + 1. Setting equal to zero:\n\n(x)/2 + 1 = 0\n\nSubtracting 1:\n\n(x)/2 = -1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\nx = -2\n\nBut since this is x > 1, x = -2 is not valid. So, no solution in this case.\n\nThus, the only solution is x = -3, and the sum is -3.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says to find the sum of all values of x such that f(x) = 0. If there's only one value, then the sum is just that value. So, the answer should be -3.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me plug x = -3 into f(x) to see if it indeed gives zero.\n\nf(-3) = -(-3) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0. Yes, that works.\n\nNow, let me plug x = -2 into the second case to see what f(-2) is.\n\nf(-2) = (-2)/2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0. Wait a minute, that also gives zero. But x = -2 is not in the domain of the second case because x > 1. So, x = -2 is not a valid solution.\n\nWait, but when I solved the second case, I got x = -2, which is not in the domain. So, in reality, x = -2 is not a valid solution for this problem because it doesn't satisfy the condition x > 1. Therefore, the only solution is x = -3.\n\nHence, the sum of all such x is -3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in solving the equations. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst case:\n\nf(x) = -x - 3 = 0\n\nAdding x to both sides:\n\n0 + x = -3 + x\n\nWait, that's not the right way to do it. Let me just solve for x directly.\n\nFrom -x - 3 = 0:\n\nAdd x to both sides:\n\n-3 = x\n\nSo, x = -3. Correct.\n\nSecond case:\n\nf(x) = (x)/2 + 1 = 0\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n(x)/2 = -1\n\nMultiply by 2:\n\nx = -2\n\nBut x = -2 is not greater than 1, so it's invalid. Therefore, no solution in this case.\n\nThus, only solution is x = -3, so the sum is -3.\n\nWait, but the problem says to find the sum of all x such that f(x) = 0. So, if there's only one x, the sum is just that x. So, the answer is -3.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer is -3.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for x where f(x) = 0, we consider both cases of the piecewise function.\n\n1. For x \u2264 1:\n   - f(x) = -x - 3\n   - Set to zero: -x - 3 = 0 \u2192 x = -3\n   - Check: x = -3 \u2264 1, valid.\n\n2. For x > 1:\n   - f(x) = (x)/2 + 1\n   - Set to zero: (x)/2 + 1 = 0 \u2192 x = -2\n   - Check: x = -2 > 1, invalid.\n\nOnly x = -3 satisfies f(x) = 0. Thus, the sum of all such x is -3.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{-3}",

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are four points given in a table format. The \\( x \\)-values are 1, 3, 5, and the corresponding \\( y \\)-values are 7, 13, 19. All these points lie on a straight line, which means they satisfy the equation of a straight line. So, my goal is to find the equation of this line and then use it to find the \\( y \\)-value when \\( x = 28 \\).\n\nTo find the equation of a straight line, I can use the slope-intercept form, which is \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept. Alternatively, I can use the point-slope form, which is \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), where \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is a point on the line and \\( m \\) is the slope. Either method should work, but I think using the slope-intercept form might be more straightforward because I can calculate the slope first and then find the y-intercept.\n\nSo, let me calculate the slope \\( m \\) using two of the points. The slope between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by \\( m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\). Let me pick the first two points: \\( (1, 7) \\) and \\( (3, 13) \\).\n\nPlugging these into the slope formula: \\( m = \\frac{13 - 7}{3 - 1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\). So, the slope \\( m \\) is 3.\n\nNow that I have the slope, I can use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of the line. I can plug in the slope and one of the points into the equation to solve for \\( b \\). Let me use the point \\( (1, 7) \\) because the numbers are smaller and might be easier to work with.\n\nPlugging into \\( y = mx + b \\): \\( 7 = 3(1) + b \\). That simplifies to \\( 7 = 3 + b \\). Subtracting 3 from both sides gives \\( b = 4 \\). So, the y-intercept \\( b \\) is 4.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is \\( y = 3x + 4 \\). Let me verify this with another point to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's use the point \\( (3, 13) \\).\n\nPlugging into \\( y = 3x + 4 \\): \\( y = 3(3) + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 \\). That matches the given \\( y \\)-value, so that seems correct.\n\nNow, to find \\( t \\) when \\( x = 28 \\), I can plug 28 into the equation \\( y = 3x + 4 \\). So, \\( y = 3(28) + 4 = 84 + 4 = 88 \\). Therefore, \\( t = 88 \\).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, \\( 3 \\times 28 \\) is indeed 84, and adding 4 gives 88. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used another pair of points to calculate the slope and verify the equation. Let me try using the points \\( (3, 13) \\) and \\( (5, 19) \\).\n\nCalculating the slope \\( m \\): \\( m = \\frac{19 - 13}{5 - 3} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\). So, the slope is still 3, which confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nUsing the point \\( (3, 13) \\) in the slope-intercept form: \\( 13 = 3(3) + b \\) gives \\( 13 = 9 + b \\), so \\( b = 4 \\). Same as before. So, the equation is consistent across different pairs of points.\n\nTherefore, using \\( x = 28 \\), the corresponding \\( y \\)-value is indeed 88. So, \\( t = 88 \\).\n\nI think that covers all the steps. I calculated the slope, found the equation of the line, verified it with another point, and then used the equation to find the required \\( y \\)-value when \\( x = 28 \\). It all checks out, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( t \\) such that the point \\( (28, t) \\) lies on the same straight line as the points given in the table, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given points**: \n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{c|c}\n   x & y \\\\\n   \\hline\n   1 & 7 \\\\\n   3 & 13 \\\\\n   5 & 19 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the slope (\\( m \\))**:\n   Use two points, for example, \\( (1, 7) \\) and \\( (3, 13) \\):\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{13 - 7}{3 - 1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Determine the y-intercept (\\( b \\))**:\n   Using the point \\( (1, 7) \\) in the equation \\( y = mx + b \\):\n   \\[\n   7 = 3(1) + b \\implies b = 4\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Write the equation of the line**:\n   \\[\n   y = 3x + 4\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Find \\( t \\) when \\( x = 28 \\)**:\n   Substitute \\( x = 28 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   y = 3(28) + 4 = 84 + 4 = 88\n   \\]\n   \nTherefore, the value of \\( t \\) is \\( \\boxed{88} \\).",

What is the smallest $n$ for which the $n$th term of the sequence is divisible by one million? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a geometric sequence where the first term is 3/4 and the second term is 15. We need to find the smallest n such that the nth term is divisible by one million, which is 10^6.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio, r. So, if the first term is a, then the second term is a*r, the third term is a*r^2, and so on. \n\nGiven that the first term is 3/4 and the second term is 15, I can set up the equation: 3/4 * r = 15. Let me solve for r. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 gives: 3r = 60. Then, dividing both sides by 3: r = 20. So, the common ratio is 20.\n\nNow, the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by a*r^(n-1). Plugging in the known values: (3/4)*20^(n-1). We need this term to be divisible by one million, so we need (3/4)*20^(n-1) to be a multiple of 10^6.\n\nLet me express 20 as 2^2 * 5, so 20^(n-1) is (2^2 * 5)^(n-1) = 2^(2(n-1)) * 5^(n-1). Similarly, 3/4 is 3/(2^2), so when we multiply (3/4) by 20^(n-1), we get (3/(2^2)) * (2^(2(n-1)) * 5^(n-1)).\n\nSimplifying this, the 2^2 in the denominator cancels with the 2^2 in the numerator, leaving us with 3 * 2^(2(n-1) - 2) * 5^(n-1). So, the nth term is 3 * 2^(2(n-1) - 2) * 5^(n-1).\n\nWe need this term to be divisible by 10^6, which is 2^6 * 5^6. So, we need the exponents of 2 and 5 in the nth term to be at least 6 each.\n\nLooking at the nth term expression: 3 * 2^(2(n-1) - 2) * 5^(n-1). The exponent of 2 is (2(n-1) - 2) and the exponent of 5 is (n-1). We can ignore the 3 since it doesn't contribute to divisibility by 2 or 5.\n\nSo, let's set up inequalities:\n\nFor 2's exponent: 2(n-1) - 2 >= 6\n\nSimplify: 2n - 2 - 2 >= 6 => 2n - 4 >= 6 => 2n >= 10 => n >= 5\n\nFor 5's exponent: n - 1 >= 6 => n >= 7\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, n must be at least 7.\n\nBut wait, let's check if n=7 actually satisfies both conditions.\n\nFor the 2's exponent: 2(7-1) - 2 = 2*6 -2 =12 -2=10, which is >=6.\n\nFor the 5's exponent:7 -1=6, which is equal to 6.\n\nSo, n=7 satisfies both conditions.\n\nTherefore, the smallest n is 7.\n\nI should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the nth term: (3/4)*20^(n-1)\n\n20^(n-1) is 2^(2(n-1)) * 5^(n-1)\n\nMultiplying by 3/4: (3/4)*2^(2(n-1)) *5^(n-1)\n\nWhich becomes 3*2^(2(n-1)-2)*5^(n-1)\n\nSo, exponents of 2: 2(n-1) -2=2n-2-2=2n-4\n\nExponents of 5: n-1\n\nWe need 2n-4 >=6 and n-1 >=6\n\nFirst inequality:2n-4 >=6 =>2n>=10=>n>=5\n\nSecond inequality:n-1>=6=>n>=7\n\nSo, n>=7\n\nSo, the smallest n is 7.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest \\( n \\) for which the \\( n \\)th term of the geometric sequence is divisible by one million, we start by determining the common ratio \\( r \\).\n\nGiven the first term \\( a = \\frac{3}{4} \\) and the second term \\( ar = 15 \\), we solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot r = 15 \\implies r = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe \\( n \\)th term of the geometric sequence is:\n\\[\na \\cdot r^{n-1} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 20^{n-1}\n\\]\n\nWe need this term to be divisible by \\( 10^6 \\).

Problem: How many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I have a set of numbers from 1 to 6, and I need to look at all possible pairs of distinct numbers in this set. For each pair, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one to get a positive difference. Then, I need to figure out how many different such differences there are.\n\nSo, the plan is to list out all possible differences and then count the unique ones. That seems straightforward, but maybe there's a smarter way to do this without having to list all possible pairs, which could take a while.\n\nLet me start by listing all the possible pairs and their differences. Since the set has 6 elements, the number of possible pairs is C(6,2) which is 15. That's manageable, but maybe I can find a pattern or a shortcut.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I can think about the maximum and minimum differences first. The smallest difference would be between consecutive numbers, like 2 - 1 = 1, 3 - 2 = 1, and so on. So the smallest difference I can get is 1.\n\nWhat about the largest difference? That would be the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the set, which is 6 - 1 = 5. So the largest difference is 5.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if all the numbers from 1 to 5 are achievable as differences. Let me verify that.\n\nStarting with 1: As I thought earlier, 2-1=1, 3-2=1, etc. So 1 is achievable.\n\n2: Let's see. How can I get a difference of 2? Well, 3-1=2, 4-2=2, 5-3=2, 6-4=2. So yes, 2 is achievable.\n\n3: How about 3? Let's see. 4-1=3, 5-2=3, 6-3=3. So 3 is achievable.\n\n4: How about 4? 5-1=4, 6-2=4. So 4 is achievable.\n\n5: As I mentioned earlier, 6-1=5, so 5 is achievable.\n\nSo, from 1 to 5, all differences are achievable. That means the number of different positive integers is 5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any differences or include any that aren't possible.\n\nFor example, can I get a difference of 6? Well, the maximum difference is 5, so 6 isn't possible.\n\nWhat about a difference of 0? No, because we're only considering positive differences.\n\nAnd differences like 7 or 8? No, the set only goes up to 6, so the maximum difference is 5.\n\nSo, all differences from 1 to 5 are possible, and beyond that, it's not possible. So the total number of different positive integers is 5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any differences. Let me list out all the differences I can get:\n\nFrom 1:\n- 2-1=1\n- 3-1=2\n- 4-1=3\n- 5-1=4\n- 6-1=5\n\nFrom 2:\n- 3-2=1\n- 4-2=2\n- 5-2=3\n- 6-2=4\n\nFrom 3:\n- 4-3=1\n- 5-3=2\n- 6-3=3\n\nFrom 4:\n- 5-4=1\n- 6-4=2\n\nFrom 5:\n- 6-5=1\n\nSo, compiling all the differences: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nThat's five distinct differences. So, the answer should be 5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. For example, can I get a difference of 4? Yes, 5-1=4 or 6-2=4.\n\nDifference of 3: 4-1=3, 5-2=3, 6-3=3.\n\nDifference of 2: 3-1=2, 4-2=2, 5-3=2, 6-4=2.\n\nDifference of 1: 2-1=1, 3-2=1, etc.\n\nSo, yes, all differences from 1 to 5 are achievable, and beyond that, it's not possible. So the total number is 5.\n\nI think that's solid.

I need to find the value of this entire fraction.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the structure of the numerator. It starts with 2016 divided by 1, then 2015 divided by 2, 2014 divided by 3, and so on, until the last term is 1 divided by 2016. So, each term in the numerator can be represented as (2017 - k)/k, where k goes from 1 to 2016. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWhen k=1, the term is 2016/1, which is (2017 - 1)/1, so that works. When k=2, it's 2015/2, which is (2017 - 2)/2, so that also works. So, in general, each term in the numerator is (2017 - k)/k, where k is from 1 to 2016. So, the numerator can be written as the sum from k=1 to 2016 of (2017 - k)/k.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nNumerator = \u03a3 (from k=1 to 2016) [ (2017 - k) / k ]\n\nI can split this into two separate sums:\n\n= \u03a3 (from k=1 to 2016) [ 2017/k - k/k ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= \u03a3 (from k=1 to 2016) [ 2017/k - 1 ]\n\nSo, this becomes:\n\n= \u03a3 (2017/k) - \u03a3 (1)\n\nThe first sum is 2017 times the sum of 1/k from k=1 to 2016, and the second sum is just adding 1, 2016 times, so that's 2016.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is:\n\n2017 * (\u03a3 (1/k)) from k=1 to 2016 - 2016\n\nNow, let me note that the denominator of the overall fraction is:\n\nDenominator = \u03a3 (from m=2 to 2017) [1/m]\n\nWhich is the same as (\u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017) minus 1/1.\n\nSo, Denominator = (\u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017) - 1\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDenominator = (\u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017) - 1\n\nNow, going back to the numerator, which is:\n\n2017 * (\u03a3 (1/k) from k=1 to 2016) - 2016\n\nBut notice that \u03a3 (1/k) from k=1 to 2016 is almost the same as \u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017, except it's missing the term 1/2017.\n\nSo, \u03a3 (1/k) from k=1 to 2016 = \u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017 - 1/2017\n\nTherefore, we can substitute that into the numerator:\n\nNumerator = 2017 * [ \u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017 - 1/2017 ] - 2016\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n= 2017 * \u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017 - 2017*(1/2017) - 2016\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= 2017 * \u03a3 (1/m) - 1 - 2016\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n-1 -2016 = -2017\n\nSo, numerator becomes:\n\n2017 * \u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017 - 2017\n\nFactor out 2017:\n\n= 2017 * [ \u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017 - 1 ]\n\nWait a second, look at the denominator. The denominator is:\n\nDenominator = (\u03a3 (1/m) from m=1 to 2017) - 1\n\nSo, that's exactly the same as what's inside the brackets in the numerator. Therefore, the numerator is 2017 times the denominator.\n\nTherefore, the fraction becomes:\n\nNumerator / Denominator = (2017 * Denominator) / Denominator = 2017\n\nWow, so the value of the entire fraction is 2017.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. I expressed the numerator as a sum where each term is (2017 - k)/k, which I split into 2017/k - 1.\n\n2. Then, I expressed the numerator as 2017 times the sum of 1/k from 1 to 2016 minus 2016.\n\n3. I noticed that the sum from 1 to 2016 is equal to the sum from 1 to 2017 minus 1/2017.\n\n4. Substituting that into the numerator, I found that the numerator is 2017 times (sum from 1 to 2017) minus 2017.\n\n5. The denominator is (sum from 1 to 2017) minus 1.\n\n6. So, the numerator is 2017 times the denominator, hence the fraction is 2017.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2017}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of the given fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{2016}{1} + \\frac{2015}{2} + \\frac{2014}{3} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{2016}}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{2017}},\n\\]\n\nwe start by analyzing the numerator. Each term in the numerator can be represented as \\(\\frac{2017 - k}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 1 to 2016. This can be split into two separate sums:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Numerator} = \\sum_{k=1}^{2016} \\left( \\frac{2017 - k}{k} \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2016} \\left( \\frac{2017}{k} - 1 \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2017 \\sum_{k=1}^{2016} \\frac{1}{k} - 2016.\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the denominator. The denominator is a sum of reciprocals starting from \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) up to \\(\\frac{1}{2017}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator} = \\sum_{m=2}^{2017} \\frac{1}{m} = \\sum_{m=1}",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: 23 people attend a party. Each person shakes hands with at most 22 other people. What is the maximum possible number of handshakes, assuming that any two people can shake hands at most once? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where 23 people attend a party. Each person can shake hands with at most 22 other people. I need to find the maximum possible number of handshakes, with the condition that any two people can shake hands at most once. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with handshakes or connections between people, it's often related to combinations. Like, if there are n people and each can shake hands with n-1 others, the total number of possible handshakes would be the combination of n people taken 2 at a time, which is n(n-1)/2. That makes sense because each handshake is between two people.\n\nSo, applying that to this problem, with 23 people, the maximum number of handshakes would be 23 times 22 divided by 2. Let me write that out:\n\n23 * 22 / 2 = (23 * 22) / 2\n\nCalculating 23 * 22 first: 23 * 20 is 460, and 23 * 2 is 46, so 460 + 46 = 506. Then divide that by 2: 506 / 2 = 253.\n\nSo, according to that, the maximum number of handshakes would be 253.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem states that each person can shake hands with at most 22 others. That means each person can shake hands with 22 people, but in reality, the maximum number of handshakes for the entire party would be the sum of all individual handshakes divided by 2, because each handshake is counted twice when you add up all the individual counts.\n\nSo, if each of the 23 people can shake hands with 22 others, the total number of handshakes would be 23 * 22. But since each handshake is counted twice in this total, we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of unique handshakes. That gives us (23 * 22) / 2 = 253, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of handshakes is 253.\n\nWait a second, I'm wondering if there's any restriction I'm missing here. The problem says each person can shake hands with at most 22 others, but does that mean that in the entire party, each person can only have 22 handshakes, or is it that each person can only have 22 handshakes regardless of the others? I think it's the latter\u2014each person can only have 22 handshakes, regardless of how many others are at the party. So, in the context of the party, each person can only shake hands with 22 others, but the overall party can have more handshakes because different people can shake hands with different numbers of people.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. If each person can shake hands with 22 others, that means each person is not shaking hands with one person. So, in the entire party, each person is not shaking hands with one person, but the total number of handshakes would still be 23 * 22 / 2, which is 253. So, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me think of a simpler example to test this. Suppose there are 2 people at a party. Each person can shake hands with 1 other person. So, the maximum number of handshakes would be 1. Using the formula: 2 * 1 / 2 = 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 3 people. Each person can shake hands with 2 others. The maximum number of handshakes would be 3. Using the formula: 3 * 2 / 2 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSo, applying this to 23 people, each shaking hands with 22 others, the maximum number of handshakes would indeed be 253.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't think of any scenario where this wouldn't apply, unless there's some kind of restriction I'm not considering, like people not shaking hands with certain people, but the problem doesn't mention that. It just says each person can shake hands with at most 22 others, and the maximum number of handshakes is when everyone is shaking hands with everyone else except themselves.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that 253 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the maximum number of handshakes at a party with 23 people, where each person can shake hands with at most 22 others, we use the combination formula for choosing 2 people out of 23:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{23 \\times 22}{2} = 253\n\\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:** We have 23 people, and each can shake hands with 22 others. We need to find the maximum unique handshakes.\n\n2. **Apply Combination Formula:** The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 23 is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum Handshakes:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{23 \\times 22}{2} = \\frac{506}{2} = 253\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The maximum possible number of handshakes is \\boxed{253}.",

Problem: Find the sum of the coefficients in the polynomial $-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this polynomial problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because polynomials can get tricky. Let me take it step by step. The problem is asking me to find the sum of the coefficients in the given polynomial. The polynomial is:\n\n-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)\n\nHmm, I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial can be found by plugging in x = 1. That makes sense because each term becomes just the coefficient times 1 raised to some power, which is 1. So, adding them up should give me the sum of all the coefficients. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The question is specifically about the sum of the coefficients, not the sum of all the terms in the polynomial. So, yeah, plugging in x = 1 should give me the sum of the coefficients. \n\nAlright, so let me try that. I'll substitute x = 1 into the polynomial and compute the result. Let's see:\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the polynomial with x = 1:\n\n-2(1^7 - 1^4 + 3*1^2 - 5) + 4(1^3 + 2*1) - 3(1^5 - 4)\n\nNow, let me compute each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first term: -2(1^7 - 1^4 + 3*1^2 - 5)\n\nCompute inside the parentheses:\n\n1^7 is 1.\n\n1^4 is 1.\n\n3*1^2 is 3*1 = 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 1 - 1 + 3 - 5\n\nCompute that: 1 - 1 is 0, 0 + 3 is 3, 3 - 5 is -2.\n\nSo, the first term becomes: -2*(-2) which is 4.\n\nSecond term: +4(1^3 + 2*1)\n\nCompute inside the parentheses:\n\n1^3 is 1.\n\n2*1 is 2.\n\nSo, 1 + 2 is 3.\n\nMultiply by 4: 4*3 = 12.\n\nThird term: -3(1^5 - 4)\n\nCompute inside the parentheses:\n\n1^5 is 1.\n\n1 - 4 is -3.\n\nMultiply by -3: -3*(-3) = 9.\n\nNow, add all the terms together: 4 + 12 + 9 = 25.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 25.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the signs.\n\nFirst term: -2*(1 - 1 + 3 -5) = -2*(-2) = 4. That seems right.\n\nSecond term: 4*(1 + 2) = 4*3 = 12. Correct.\n\nThird term: -3*(1 -4) = -3*(-3) = 9. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 4 + 12 = 16, 16 + 9 = 25. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I did that right. The sum of the coefficients is 25.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find all the coefficients individually, I could expand the entire polynomial and then add up all the coefficients. But that seems like a longer process, and I already got 25 by plugging in x=1, so I think that's sufficient.\n\nWait, let me think again. Another way to find the sum of coefficients is to actually expand the polynomial, collect like terms, and then add the coefficients. But that might take longer, but perhaps I can try it to confirm.\n\nLet me expand each part:\n\nFirst part: -2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5)\n\n= -2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10\n\nSecond part: +4(x^3 + 2x)\n\n= 4x^3 + 8x\n\nThird part: -3(x^5 - 4)\n\n= -3x^5 + 12\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms:\n\n-2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10 + 4x^3 + 8x - 3x^5 + 12\n\nNow, let's arrange them in descending order of exponents:\n\n-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + (10 + 12)\n\nCompute the constants: 10 + 12 = 22.\n\nSo, the expanded polynomial is:\n\n-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\n\nNow, let's list all the coefficients:\n\n-2 (for x^7)\n0 (since there's no x^6 term)\n-3 (for x^5)\n2 (for x^4)\n4 (for x^3)\n-6 (for x^2)\n8 (for x)\n22 (constant term)\n\nNow, adding all these coefficients together:\n\n-2 + 0 + (-3) + 2 + 4 + (-6) + 8 + 22\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\nStart with -2.\n\nAdd 0: still -2.\n\nAdd -3: -5.\n\nAdd 2: -3.\n\nAdd 4: 1.\n\nAdd -6: -5.\n\nAdd 8: 3.\n\nAdd 22: 25.\n\nSo, again, the sum of the coefficients is 25.\n\nSo, that confirms it. Both methods give me the same result, so I can be confident that the sum of the coefficients is 25.\n\nI think that's all. I considered plugging in x=1, which is straightforward, and then expanding and adding the coefficients. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I don't think I made any mistakes. I feel pretty good about this now.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients in the polynomial, we can substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the polynomial and compute the result.\n\nGiven polynomial:\n\\[\n-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 1 \\):\n\\[\n-2(1^7 - 1^4 + 3 \\cdot 1^2 - 5) + 4(1^3 + 2 \\cdot 1) - 3(1^5 - 4)\n\\]\n\nCompute each term:\n\\[\n1^7 = 1, \\quad 1^4 = 1, \\quad 3 \\cdot 1^2 = 3, \\quad 1^5 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - 1 + 3 - 5 = -2\n\\]\n\\[\n-2 \\cdot (-2) = 4\n\\]\n\nNext term:\n\\[\n1^3 = 1, \\quad 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext term:\n\\[\n1 - 4 = -3\n\\]\n\\[\n-3 \\cdot (-3) = 9\n\\]\n\nAdd all terms together:\n\\[\n4 + 12 + 9 = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the coefficients is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

Let $B$ be the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 4x + 10 $. What is the distance between $A$ and $B$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the distance between two vertices, A and B. Both of these vertices are from the graphs of quadratic equations. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each vertex represents. The vertex of a parabola given by the equation y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c is a point (h, k), where h is the x-coordinate and k is the y-coordinate. Since the equations given are in the form y = x\u00b2 + something, the coefficient a is 1, so the parabolas open upwards.\n\nNow, I need to find the vertices A and B for their respective equations. Let's start with point A, which is the vertex of y = x\u00b2 - 2x + 3.\n\nTo find the vertex of a quadratic equation in standard form y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate can be found using the formula h = -b/(2a). Once I have h, I can plug it back into the equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate k.\n\nSo for equation y = x\u00b2 - 2x + 3, the coefficients are a = 1, b = -2, and c = 3.\n\nCalculating h:\nh = -b/(2a) = -(-2)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1.\n\nNow, plugging h = 1 back into the equation to find k:\nk = (1)\u00b2 - 2*(1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2.\n\nSo, point A is at (1, 2).\n\nNext, let's find point B, which is the vertex of y = x\u00b2 + 4x + 10.\n\nAgain, using the formula h = -b/(2a), where a = 1, b = 4.\n\nCalculating h:\nh = -4/(2*1) = -4/2 = -2.\n\nNow, plugging h = -2 back into the equation to find k:\nk = (-2)\u00b2 + 4*(-2) + 10 = 4 - 8 + 10 = 6.\n\nSo, point B is at (-2, 6).\n\nNow, I need to find the distance between points A (1, 2) and B (-2, 6). To do this, I'll use the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\nd = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of A and B:\nx1 = 1, y1 = 2\nx2 = -2, y2 = 6\n\nCalculating the differences:\nx2 - x1 = -2 - 1 = -3\ny2 - y1 = 6 - 2 = 4\n\nNow, squaring these differences:\n(-3)\u00b2 = 9\n4\u00b2 = 16\n\nAdding them together:\n9 + 16 = 25\n\nTaking the square root:\n\u221a25 = 5\n\nSo, the distance between points A and B is 5 units.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor point A:\nh = -b/(2a) = -(-2)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1\nk = (1)\u00b2 - 2*(1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2\nSo, A is (1, 2). Correct.\n\nFor point B:\nh = -b/(2a) = -(4)/(2*1) = -4/2 = -2\nk = (-2)\u00b2 + 4*(-2) + 10 = 4 - 8 + 10 = 6\nSo, B is (-2, 6). Correct.\n\nDistance calculation:\nx difference: -2 - 1 = -3\ny difference: 6 - 2 = 4\nSquares: 9 and 16\nSum: 25\nSquare root: 5\nYes, that seems right.\n\nI think I've got it correct. The distance between A and B is 5 units.\n</think>\n\nTo find the distance between the vertices A and B, we first determine their coordinates.\n\n1. **Finding Point A:**\n   - Equation: \\( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \\)\n   - Using \\( h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -2 \\):\n     \\[ h = -\\frac{-2}{2*1} = 1 \\]\n   - Substitute \\( h = 1 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[ k = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 3 = 2 \\]\n   - So, A is at (1, 2).\n\n2. **Finding Point B:**\n   - Equation: \\( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \\)\n   - Using \\( h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\):\n     \\[ h = -\\frac{4}{2*1} = -2 \\]\n   - Substitute \\( h = -2 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[ k = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 10 = 6 \\]\n   - So, B is at (-2, 6).\n\n3. **Calculating Distance AB:**\n   - Using the distance formula:\n     \\[ d = \\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \\]\n     \\[ d = \\sqrt{(-2 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} \\]\n     \\[ d = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (4)^2} \\]\n     \\[ d = \\sqrt{9 + 16} \\]\n     \\[ d = \\sqrt{25} \\]\n     \\[ d = 5 \\]\n\n**Answer:** The distance between A and B is \\boxed{5}.",

Let me start by writing down the equation: ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0. I know that a isn't zero, which is good because if a were zero, it wouldn't be a cubic equation anymore.\n\nThe problem states that two of the roots are 3 and -2. So, that means when x is 3, the equation equals zero, and the same goes when x is -2. Let me write those out as equations:\n\n1. a*(3)\u00b3 + b*(3)\u00b2 + c*(3) + d = 0\n2. a*(-2)\u00b3 + b*(-2)\u00b2 + c*(-2) + d = 0\n\nLet me compute those values step by step.\n\nFor the first equation, 3\u00b3 is 27, so a*27. Then 3\u00b2 is 9, so b*9. 3 is just c. And then d. So the first equation becomes:\n\n27a + 9b + 3c + d = 0  ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, (-2)\u00b3 is -8, so a*(-8) is -8a. Then (-2)\u00b2 is 4, so b*4 is 4b. Then (-2)*c is -2c. And d remains. So the second equation becomes:\n\n-8a + 4b - 2c + d = 0  ...(2)\n\nNow, I have two equations, but there are four unknowns: a, b, c, d. I need more information to solve for these variables. But wait, the problem doesn't ask for a, b, c, or d individually; it just wants (b + c)/a. Hmm, that might be possible without knowing all the variables. Let me see.\n\nI need to find (b + c)/a. Maybe I can manipulate the equations I have to get (b + c)/a. Let me think about how to combine equations (1) and (2) to get (b + c) in terms of a.\n\nFirst, let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1). That might help eliminate some variables or combine them in a useful way.\n\nSo, equation (1) minus equation (2):\n\n(27a - (-8a)) + (9b - 4b) + (3c - (-2c)) + (d - d) = 0 - 0\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n27a + 8a = 35a\n\n9b - 4b = 5b\n\n3c - (-2c) = 3c + 2c = 5c\n\nd - d = 0\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n35a + 5b + 5c = 0\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me factor out a 5 from all the terms:\n\n5*(7a + b + c) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n7a + b + c = 0  ...(3)\n\nSo, equation (3) is 7a + b + c = 0. Now, I need to find (b + c)/a. Let me see how equation (3) relates to that.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nb + c = -7a\n\nSo, (b + c)/a = (-7a)/a = -7\n\nSo, the value of (b + c)/a is -7.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I wrote down the two equations correctly when substituting x = 3 and x = -2. Then, I subtracted equation (2) from equation (1), which should eliminate d since it's on both sides. Then, I simplified each term:\n\n27a - (-8a) = 35a, that's correct.\n\n9b - 4b = 5b, correct.\n\n3c - (-2c) = 5c, correct.\n\nd - d = 0, correct.\n\nThen, factoring out 5: 5*(7a + b + c) = 0, which simplifies to 7a + b + c = 0.\n\nThen, solving for b + c: b + c = -7a, so (b + c)/a = -7.\n\nThat seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the answer should be -7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\frac{b+c}{a}$ is \\boxed{-7}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the cubic equation \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\) with roots 3 and -2, we need to compute \\(\\frac{b+c}{a}\\).\n\nFirst, we substitute the roots into the equation:\n\n1.

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5616 and 11609. Hmm, I remember that the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. There are a few methods to find the GCD, like the prime factorization method or the Euclidean algorithm. Since these numbers are pretty big, prime factorization might take too long. I think the Euclidean algorithm is more efficient. Let me recall how that works.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then replacing the larger number with the smaller one and the smaller number with the remainder from the division. You keep doing this until the remainder is zero, and the non-zero remainder just before that is the GCD. So, let me apply that to 5616 and 11609.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 11609 by 5616. Let me calculate how many times 5616 fits into 11609. \n\n5616 times 2 is 11232. If I subtract that from 11609, the remainder is 11609 - 11232 = 377. So, the remainder is 377.\n\nNow, I'll take the previous divisor, which was 5616, and divide it by the remainder, 377. \n\nLet me see how many times 377 goes into 5616. 377 times 15 is 5655, which is a bit more than 5616. So, 14 times 377 is 5278. Subtracting that from 5616 gives 5616 - 5278 = 338. So, the remainder is 338.\n\nNext, I'll take the previous remainder, 377, and divide it by 338. \n\n338 goes into 377 once, since 338 times 1 is 338. Subtracting that from 377 gives 377 - 338 = 39. So, the remainder is 39.\n\nNow, I'll take the previous remainder, 338, and divide it by 39. \n\n39 times 8 is 312. Subtracting that from 338 gives 338 - 312 = 26. So, the remainder is 26.\n\nNext, I'll divide the previous remainder, 39, by 26. \n\n26 times 1 is 26. Subtracting that from 39 gives 39 - 26 = 13. So, the remainder is 13.\n\nNow, I'll divide the previous remainder, 26, by 13. \n\n13 times 2 is 26. Subtracting that gives 26 - 26 = 0. So, the remainder is zero.\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of zero, the last non-zero remainder is 13. Therefore, the GCD of 5616 and 11609 is 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nFirst division: 11609 \u00f7 5616. 5616*2=11232. 11609-11232=377. That's correct.\n\nSecond division: 5616 \u00f7 377. 377*14=5278. 5616-5278=338. Correct.\n\nThird division: 377 \u00f7 338. 338*1=338. 377-338=39. Correct.\n\nFourth division: 338 \u00f7 39. 39*8=312. 338-312=26. Correct.\n\nFifth division: 39 \u00f7 26. 26*1=26. 39-26=13. Correct.\n\nSixth division: 26 \u00f7 13. 13*2=26. 26-26=0.

Divide 11609 by 5616. The remainder is 377.\n2. Divide 5616 by 377. The remainder is 338.\n3. Divide 377 by 338. The remainder is 39.\n4. Divide 338 by 39. The remainder is 26.\n5. Divide 39 by 26. The remainder is 13.\n6. Divide 26 by 13. The remainder is 0.\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 13, so the GCD of 5616 and 11609 is 13.\n\n$\\boxed{13}$",

What was his average speed, in miles per hour, for the entire ride? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out Dave's average speed for his entire ride. Let me start by understanding the problem. Dave rode two parts: first, he went 30 miles at 10 miles per hour, and then he went another 10 miles at 30 miles per hour. I need to find his average speed for the entire trip.\n\nOkay, average speed is generally total distance divided by total time. So I need to calculate the total distance he rode and the total time he took for that ride. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance. He rode 30 miles and then 10 miles. So total distance is 30 + 10 = 40 miles. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time he took for these two parts. Since speed is distance divided by time, time is distance divided by speed. I can calculate the time for each part separately and then add them together.\n\nStarting with the first part: he rode 30 miles at 10 mph. So time taken for this part is distance divided by speed, which is 30 miles / 10 mph. Let me do that calculation: 30 divided by 10 is 3. So, 3 hours.\n\nNext, the second part: he rode 10 miles at 30 mph. Again, time is distance divided by speed, so 10 miles / 30 mph. Let me calculate that: 10 divided by 30 is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333... hours.\n\nSo, total time is 3 hours plus 1/3 hours. Let me add those together. 3 is the same as 9/3, so 9/3 + 1/3 = 10/3 hours. That's approximately 3.333... hours.\n\nNow, average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, total distance is 40 miles, and total time is 10/3 hours. So average speed is 40 divided by (10/3). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 40 times (3/10).\n\nLet me compute that: 40 multiplied by 3 is 120, and 120 divided by 10 is 12. So, the average speed is 12 miles per hour.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, total distance is 30 + 10 = 40 miles. That's correct.\n\nTotal time: first part is 30/10 = 3 hours, second part is 10/30 = 1/3 hours. Adding those gives 3 + 1/3 = 10/3 hours. Correct.\n\nAverage speed: 40 divided by (10/3) = 40 * (3/10) = (40/10)*3 = 4*3 = 12. Yes, that seems right.\n\nI think I've got it.

Find $\\sin B$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a right triangle BCD where angle D is 90 degrees. The sides given are BC = 9 and BD = 4. I need to find sin B. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since it's a right triangle, I remember that the Pythagorean theorem applies. That is, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, maybe I can use that to find the missing side.\n\nLet me label the triangle properly. In triangle BCD, angle D is 90 degrees, so sides BD and CD are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, actually, BD is one leg, and CD is the other leg. But I don't know CD yet. The problem gives me BD = 4 and BC = 9.\n\nSo, applying the Pythagorean theorem: BC\u00b2 = BD\u00b2 + CD\u00b2. Plugging in the values: 9\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + CD\u00b2. That is, 81 = 16 + CD\u00b2. Subtracting 16 from both sides: CD\u00b2 = 65. Therefore, CD = sqrt(65). Okay, so now I know all the sides: BD = 4, CD = sqrt(65), and BC = 9.\n\nNow, I need to find sin B. Sin of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, angle B is at vertex B, which is connected to sides BD and BC. Wait, let me visualize this triangle again.\n\nTriangle BCD with right angle at D. So, vertex B is connected to D and C. So, side BD is one leg, BC is the hypotenuse, and CD is the other leg. So, angle B is at vertex B, between sides BD and BC.\n\nTherefore, in triangle BCD, angle B is opposite to side CD and adjacent to side BD. So, sin B = opposite side / hypotenuse = CD / BC.\n\nWe already found CD as sqrt(65) and BC as 9. So, sin B = sqrt(65)/9. Is that the simplest form? Let me check if sqrt(65) can be simplified further. 65 factors into 5 and 13, neither of which are perfect squares, so sqrt(65) is already simplified. Therefore, sin B is sqrt(65)/9.\n\nWait, let me just verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I used the Pythagorean theorem correctly: BC\u00b2 = BD\u00b2 + CD\u00b2, which gave me CD\u00b2 = 81 - 16 = 65, so CD = sqrt(65). Then, for sin B, opposite side is CD, which is sqrt(65), and hypotenuse is BC, which is 9. So, sin B = sqrt(65)/9. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. The key was correctly identifying which sides correspond to which angles. Since angle B is at vertex B, it's opposite side CD and adjacent to side BD. So, using the definition of sine as opposite over hypotenuse is the right approach.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is sin B = sqrt(65)/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\sin B$ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{65}}{9}}.\n</think>\n\nIn right triangle \\(BCD\\) with \\(\\angle D = 90^\\circ\\), we have \\(BC = 9\\) and \\(BD = 4\\). We need to find \\(\\sin B\\).\n\nFirst, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side \\(CD\\).

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find all real numbers k such that the norm of k times this vector (2, -3) minus another vector (4, 7) equals 2 times the square root of 13. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write out the expression they gave. The norm is 2\u221a13, so:\n\n||k*(2, -3) - (4, 7)|| = 2\u221a13.\n\nI think the norm here refers to the Euclidean norm, which for a vector (a, b) is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, I need to compute the norm of the vector resulting from the operations on k and the other vector, set it equal to 2\u221a13, and solve for k.\n\nLet me compute the vector inside the norm first. Let's call the vector inside the norm as v. So,\n\nv = k*(2, -3) - (4, 7).\n\nBreaking this down into components, the x-component will be 2k - 4, and the y-component will be -3k - 7. So, vector v is (2k - 4, -3k - 7).\n\nNow, the norm of this vector v is sqrt[(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2]. We set this equal to 2\u221a13:\n\nsqrt[(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2] = 2\u221a13.\n\nTo get rid of the square root, I'll square both sides:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2 = (2\u221a13)\u00b2.\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n(2\u221a13)\u00b2 = 4*13 = 52.\n\nSo, now I have the equation:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2 = 52.\n\nLet me expand each squared term. Starting with (2k - 4)\u00b2:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 - 2*(2k)*(4) + (4)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 - 16k + 16.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recall that (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. So, applying that:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 - 2*(2k)*(4) + (4)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 - 16k + 16.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's expand (-3k - 7)\u00b2. Again, using (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2:\n\n(-3k - 7)\u00b2 = (-3k)\u00b2 + 2*(-3k)*(-7) + (-7)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2 + 42k + 49.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the left side becomes:\n\n(4k\u00b2 - 16k + 16) + (9k\u00b2 + 42k + 49) = 52.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4k\u00b2 + 9k\u00b2 = 13k\u00b2.\n\n-16k + 42k = 26k.\n\n16 + 49 = 65.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 65 = 52.\n\nSubtract 52 from both sides:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 13 = 0.\n\nWait, let me check that subtraction:\n\n52 - 52 = 0, so 13k\u00b2 + 26k + 65 - 52 = 0 => 13k\u00b2 + 26k + 13 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, I can see that all coefficients are multiples of 13, so I can factor that out:\n\n13(k\u00b2 + 2k + 1) = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = 0.\n\nWait a second, k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 is a perfect square. It factors into (k + 1)\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, the solution is k = -1.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from:\n\nsqrt[(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2] = 2\u221a13.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2 = 52.\n\nExpand each term:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 - 16k + 16.\n\n(-3k - 7)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2 + 42k + 49.\n\nAdd them together:\n\n4k\u00b2 - 16k + 16 + 9k\u00b2 + 42k + 49 = 13k\u00b2 + 26k + 65.\n\nSet equal to 52:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 65 = 52.\n\nSubtract 52:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 13 = 0.\n\nDivide by 13:\n\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = 0.\n\nWhich factors to (k + 1)\u00b2 = 0, so k = -1.\n\nWait, that's consistent. So, the only solution is k = -1.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me plug k = -1 back into the original expression and see if the norm indeed equals 2\u221a13.\n\nCompute the vector inside the norm:\n\nk*(2, -3) - (4, 7) = (-1)*(2, -3) - (4, 7) = (-2, 3) - (4, 7).\n\nSubtracting component-wise:\n\n(-2 - 4, 3 - 7) = (-6, -4).\n\nNow, compute the norm of (-6, -4):\n\nsqrt[(-6)\u00b2 + (-4)\u00b2] = sqrt[36 + 16] = sqrt[52] = 2\u221a13.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, k = -1 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, could there be more solutions? Let me think about the quadratic equation.\n\nWe had:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 13 = 0.\n\nWhich is a quadratic equation, and since the discriminant is (26)^2 - 4*13*13 = 676 - 676 = 0.\n\nSo, discriminant is zero, which means there is exactly one real solution, a repeated root. So, k = -1 is the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the only real number k that satisfies the given equation is -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{-1}.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we need to find the vector inside the norm:\n\n\\[\nv = k \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nBreaking this down into components, we get:\n\n\\[\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} 2k - 4 \\\\ -3k - 7 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the norm of this vector and set it equal to \\(2\\sqrt{13}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(2k - 4)^2 + (-3k - 7)^2} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n(2k - 4)^2 + (-3k - 7)^2 = (2\\sqrt{13})^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n\\[\n(2\\sqrt{13})^2 = 4 \\times 13 = 52\n\\]\n\nExpanding and combining like terms on the left side:\n\n\\[\n(2k - 4)^2 = 4",

Problem: Find all solutions to the equation\\[ \\sqrt[4]{x} = \\frac{12}{7 - \\sqrt[4]{x}}.\\] Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this equation to solve: the fourth root of x equals 12 divided by (7 minus the fourth root of x). Let me write that down to make it clearer. It looks like:\n\n\u221a\u2074x = 12 / (7 - \u221a\u2074x)\n\nHmm, so I need to find all the solutions for x. Since it's a fourth root, I should be careful about the domain. The fourth root of x is only defined for x \u2265 0, because any even root of a negative number isn't real. So x has to be zero or positive.\n\nNow, looking at the equation, it's in terms of \u221a\u2074x. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify things. Let me let y = \u221a\u2074x. That way, the equation becomes:\n\ny = 12 / (7 - y)\n\nNice, that seems simpler. Now I have an equation in terms of y, which is a linear fractional equation. Let me solve for y.\n\nFirst, I can multiply both sides by (7 - y) to eliminate the denominator. That gives me:\n\ny * (7 - y) = 12\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n7y - y\u00b2 = 12\n\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 12 from both sides:\n\n7y - y\u00b2 - 12 = 0\n\nLet me rearrange the terms in descending order of y:\n\n-y\u00b2 + 7y - 12 = 0\n\nIt's often easier to have the coefficient of y\u00b2 positive, so I'll multiply both sides by -1:\n\ny\u00b2 - 7y + 12 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation. Let me factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to -7. Hmm, factors of 12 are 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4. Let's see:\n\n-3 and -4 multiply to 12, and (-3) + (-4) = -7. Perfect.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n\n(y - 3)(y - 4) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the possible solutions for y:\n\ny - 3 = 0 \u21d2 y = 3\n\ny - 4 = 0 \u21d2 y = 4\n\nSo, y can be 3 or 4. But remember, y was defined as \u221a\u2074x. So, we can now solve for x.\n\nFirst, when y = 3:\n\n\u221a\u2074x = 3\n\nTo find x, we raise both sides to the fourth power:\n\n(\u221a\u2074x)^4 = 3^4\n\nx = 81\n\nNext, when y = 4:\n\n\u221a\u2074x = 4\n\nAgain, raising both sides to the fourth power:\n\n(\u221a\u2074x)^4 = 4^4\n\nx = 256\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 81 and x = 256. But wait, I should check if these solutions actually work in the original equation, just to be sure. Sometimes when we square or take roots, we can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nLet's check x = 81 first.\n\nCompute \u221a\u207481: 81 is 3^4, so \u221a\u207481 = 3.\n\nNow, compute the right side of the equation: 12 / (7 - \u221a\u207481) = 12 / (7 - 3) = 12 / 4 = 3.\n\nSo, both sides equal 3. That checks out.\n\nNow, let's check x = 256.\n\nCompute \u221a\u2074256: 256 is 4^4, so \u221a\u2074256 = 4.\n\nCompute the right side: 12 / (7 - \u221a\u2074256) = 12 / (7 - 4) = 12 / 3 = 4.\n\nSo, both sides equal 4. That also checks out.\n\nTherefore, both x = 81 and x = 256 are valid solutions.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Substitute y = \u221a\u2074x to simplify the equation.\n2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for y.\n3. Substitute back to find x.\n4. Check the solutions in the original equation to ensure they are valid.\n\nThis approach worked well because it transformed a complex radical equation into a quadratic, which is easier to solve. Then, substituting back and checking was necessary to avoid any mistakes.\n\nI think that's all there is to it.

I remember that subtracting decimals is similar to subtracting whole numbers, but I have to make sure to line up the decimal points correctly. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the two numbers: 333.33 and 111.11. I need to subtract the latter from the former. To do this properly, I should align the decimal points. So, I'll write:\n\n```\n  333.33\n- 111.11\n```\n\nNow, I'll subtract each corresponding digit starting from the right. Let's start with the hundredths place: 3 minus 1 is 2.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the result should be 222.22, right? Let me check my subtraction again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try subtracting digit by digit again more carefully. Starting from the right:\n\n333.33\n-111.11\n--------\n?\n\nStarting with the hundredths place: 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTenths place: 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nOnes place: 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTens place: 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nHundreds place: 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result should be 222.22. That makes sense because 333.33 minus 111.11 is indeed 222.22. Wait, but I thought 333.33 minus 100 would be 233.33, so subtracting another 11.11 should give 222.22. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I also remember that when subtracting decimals, it's important to ensure that both numbers have the same number of decimal places. In this case, both 333.33 and 111.11 have two decimal places, so lining them up correctly is fine.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to break down the numbers into their place values. For example, 333.33 can be written as 300 + 30 + 3 + 0.3 + 0.03. Similarly, 111.11 is 100 + 10 + 1 + 0.1 + 0.01. Subtracting these parts individually would also give the same result: 200 + 20 + 2 + 0.2 + 0.02, which totals 222.22.\n\nI also remember that sometimes when subtracting, if you have a situation where you can't subtract the smaller digit from the larger one without borrowing, you have to adjust accordingly. But in this case, since all the digits are equal or larger, borrowing doesn't seem necessary here. It's straightforward because each digit in the top number is equal to or larger than the corresponding digit in the bottom number.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem: 333.33 minus 111.11. I just want to make sure I didn't misread the numbers. 333.33 is correct, and 111.11 is also correct. So, subtracting these should give 222.22, which is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem, both by lining up the decimals and breaking them down into place values. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe result of subtracting $111.11 from $333.33 is $222.22.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Align the decimal points:\n```\n  333.33\n- 111.11\n```\n2. Subtract each corresponding digit:\n- Hundredths place: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Tenths place: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Ones place: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Tens place: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Hundreds place: 3 - 1 = 2\n\n3. Combine the results: 222.22\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{222.22}",

What is the minimum number of buses needed to transport 411 students? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many buses are required to transport 411 students, given that each bus can hold a maximum of 38 students. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each bus can carry 38 students. So, if I divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus, I should get the minimum number of buses needed. But wait, I should make sure that I don't have a fraction of a bus, right? Because you can't have half a bus; you have to have whole buses.\n\nSo, let me write down the numbers. The total number of students is 411, and each bus can hold 38 students. So, I'll divide 411 by 38. Let me do that calculation.\n\n411 \u00f7 38. Hmm, 38 times 10 is 380. So, subtracting that from 411 gives me 31. So, 38 times 11 is 418, which is more than 411. So, that means 11 buses would be needed because 11 buses can hold 418 students, which is more than the 411 needed.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If I have 10 buses, each holding 38 students, that's 380 students. Then, the remaining students are 411 - 380 = 31 students. So, 31 students would require another bus, making it 11 buses in total.\n\nSo, to confirm, 11 buses can carry 11 \u00d7 38 = 418 students, which is enough for the 411 students. So, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is to use division and then round up to the nearest whole number. So, 411 divided by 38 is approximately 10.842. Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you round up to 11 buses.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of buses needed is 11.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum number of buses needed to transport 411 students, given that each bus can hold a maximum of 38 students, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the total number of students by the bus capacity:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{411}{38} \\approx 10.842\n   \\]\n\n2. **Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, round up to the nearest whole number:**\n   \\[\n   \\lceil 10.842 \\rceil = 11\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify the calculation:**\n   \\[\n   11 \\text{ buses} \\times 38 \\text{ students per bus} = 418 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n   Since 418 is greater than 411, 11 buses are sufficient.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{11}",

Problem: Find the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in this list:      21, 23, 25, 27, 29 Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list: 21, 23, 25, 27, 29. Hmm, arithmetic mean means I have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. But first, I need to identify which numbers in the list are prime. \n\nLet me recall, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, starting with the first number: 21. Is 21 prime? Let me check. 21 can be divided by 3 and 7 because 3 times 7 is 21. So, 21 is not prime. \n\nNext is 23. Is 23 prime? Let me think. 23 is a well-known prime number. It can't be divided by any number other than 1 and 23. So, 23 is prime. \n\nThen 25. Is 25 prime? Hmm, 25 is 5 times 5, so that's 25. So, 25 is not prime. \n\nNext is 27. Is 27 prime? Well, 27 is 3 times 9, which is 3 times 3 times 3. So, 27 is not prime. \n\nFinally, 29. Is 29 prime? Yes, 29 is a prime number. It can't be divided by any number other than 1 and itself. \n\nSo, from the list, the prime numbers are 23 and 29. That's two prime numbers. \n\nNow, to find the arithmetic mean, I need to add these two numbers together and then divide by 2, since there are two numbers. \n\nLet's add them: 23 plus 29. 23 plus 20 is 43, and then plus 9 is 52. So, 23 plus 29 equals 52. \n\nNow, divide that by 2: 52 divided by 2 is 26. \n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list is 26. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The prime numbers are 23 and 29. Their sum is 52, divided by 2 is 26. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed any numbers in the list. Let me recount: 21, 23, 25, 27, 29.

The cylinder has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm. Hmm, I remember that in a cylinder, the longest straight line that can fit inside is the space diagonal, which goes from one point on the top circular face to the opposite point on the bottom circular face. \n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine the cylinder is standing upright. If I were to draw a line from the top of the circular base to the bottom, passing through the center, that line would be the longest possible. To find the length of this line, I can think of it as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. One side of this triangle would be the height of the cylinder, and the other side would be the diameter of the base.\n\nWait, the radius is 3 cm, so the diameter is twice that, which is 6 cm. So now, I have a right-angled triangle where one leg is 8 cm (height) and the other leg is 6 cm (diameter). The space diagonal, which is the longest segment, should be the hypotenuse of this triangle.\n\nTo find the hypotenuse, I can use the Pythagorean theorem.

What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2). Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: \"The average of the numbers 23 and x is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and x?\" Hmm, alright. I remember that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. So, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's figure out what the average of 23 and x being 27 means mathematically. The average is (23 + x) divided by 2, right? So, that equals 27. So, I can write that as an equation: (23 + x)/2 = 27. Now, I need to solve for x. To do that, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the denominator. So, 2 times (23 + x)/2 would just leave me with 23 + x, and 2 times 27 is 54. So, now I have 23 + x = 54.\n\nNext, I need to solve for x by subtracting 23 from both sides. So, x = 54 - 23. Let me calculate that. 54 minus 23 is... 31. So, x equals 31. Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If I plug x = 31 back into the original average equation, (23 + 31)/2 should equal 27. Let's see, 23 plus 31 is 54, and 54 divided by 2 is 27. Yep, that checks out.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the positive difference between 23 and x. The positive difference is just the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers. So, that would be |23 - x|. Since x is 31, let's plug that in: |23 - 31|. 23 minus 31 is -8, and the absolute value of -8 is 8. So, the positive difference is 8.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me recap. The average is 27, which comes from (23 + x)/2 = 27. Solving that gives x = 31. Then, the positive difference between 23 and 31 is 8. That seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here, but it's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with averages and differences.\n\nSo, to summarize my steps: I set up the equation based on the average, solved for x, then found the positive difference between 23 and x. Everything seems to add up correctly, so I'm confident that the positive difference is 8.\n</think>\n\nThe average of the numbers 23 and \\( x \\) is 27.

Let's group them:\n\nTerms with x\u00b2: 3x\u00b2\nTerms with y\u00b2: 8y\u00b2\nTerms with xy: 12xy + 2xy\nTerms with x: 15x + x\nTerms with y: 10y + 4y\nConstant term: 5\n\nLet me compute each group:\n\n3x\u00b2 remains as is.\n\n8y\u00b2 remains as is.\n\n12xy + 2xy = 14xy\n\n15x + x = 16x\n\n10y + 4y = 14y\n\nSo, the expanded product is:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 8y\u00b2 + 14xy + 16x + 14y + 5\n\nAlright, now that I have the expanded form, I need to identify the terms that contain a nonzero power of y. Let's go through each term:\n\n1. 3x\u00b2: This term has x\u00b2, which is a nonzero power of x, but it doesn't have y at all. So, it's a term without y. So, we can exclude this from our consideration.\n\n2. 8y\u00b2: This term has y squared, which is a nonzero power of y. So, we'll include this.\n\n3. 14xy: This term has both x and y, and the power of y is 1, which is a nonzero power. So, include this.\n\n4. 16x: This term has x, no y. So, exclude.\n\n5. 14y: This term has y, power 1. Include.\n\n6. 5: This is a constant term, no y. So, exclude.\n\nSo, the terms that contain a nonzero power of y are: 8y\u00b2, 14xy, and 14y.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of their coefficients. Coefficients are the numerical parts in front of the variables.\n\n1. For 8y\u00b2: The coefficient is 8.\n2. For 14xy: The coefficient is 14.\n3. For 14y: The coefficient is 14.\n\nSo, adding these coefficients together: 8 + 14 + 14.\n\nLet me compute that: 8 + 14 is 22, plus another 14 is 36.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of y is 36.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the expansion:\n\n(3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5) = 3x\u00b2 + 12xy + 15x + 2xy + 8y\u00b2 + 10y + x + 4y + 5\n\nGrouping:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 8y\u00b2 + (12xy + 2xy) + (15x + x) + (10y + 4y) + 5\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 8y\u00b2 + 14xy + 16x + 14y + 5\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nThen, identifying terms with nonzero y power:\n\n8y\u00b2, 14xy, 14y.\n\nCoefficients: 8, 14, 14.\n\nAdding: 8 + 14 = 22, 22 + 14 = 36.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the sum is 36.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the coefficients is \\boxed{36}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to expand the product \\((3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\\) and then find the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\(y\\).\n\nFirst, we expand the product:\n\n\\[\n(3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\n\\]\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n\\[\n3x \\cdot x = 3x^2\n\\]\n\\[\n3x \\cdot 4y = 12xy\n\\]\n\\[\n3x \\cdot 5 = 15x\n\\]\n\\[\n2y \\cdot x = 2xy\n\\]\n\\[\n2y \\cdot 4y = 8y^2\n\\]\n\\[\n2y \\cdot 5 = 10y\n\\]\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x = x\n\\]\n\\[\n1 \\cdot 4y = 4y\n\\]\n\\[\n1 \\cdot 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nCombining all these terms:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 12xy + 15x + 2xy + 8y^2 + 10y + x + 4y + 5\n\\]\n\nGrouping like terms:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 8y^2 + 14xy + 16x + 14y + 5\n\\]\n\nIdentifying the terms containing a nonzero power of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n8y^2, 14xy, 14y\n\\]\n\nSumming their coefficients:\n\n\\[\n8 + 14 + 14 = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\(y\\) is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ have? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many even perfect square factors the number \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\) has. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I remember that a factor of a number must be in the form where the exponents of the prime factors are less than or equal to the exponents in the original number. So, for \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\), any factor would be \\(2^a \\cdot 7^b\\), where \\(a\\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and \\(b\\) can be 0, 1, 2, ..., up to 9.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about even perfect square factors. Let's start with the \"even\" part. An even number must have at least one factor of 2. So, in our case, the factor must have \\(2^a\\) where \\(a\\) is at least 1. That means \\(a\\) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are 4 choices for the exponent of 2.\n\nNext, the factor has to be a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as some integer squared. In terms of prime factors, that means all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even numbers. So, for \\(2^a \\cdot 7^b\\) to be a perfect square, both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be even numbers.\n\nBut wait, we already know that \\(a\\) must be at least 1 because it's an even factor. So, \\(a\\) must be an even number greater than or equal to 2. The possible values for \\(a\\) are 2, 4. So, that's 2 choices for \\(a\\).\n\nNow, let's look at \\(b\\). Since \\(b\\) must be even, and it can go up to 9, the possible even values for \\(b\\) are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Let me count them: 0 is even, 2, 4, 6, 8. So that's 5 choices for \\(b\\).\n\nPutting it all together, the number of even perfect square factors is the number of choices for \\(a\\) multiplied by the number of choices for \\(b\\). So, that's 2 choices for \\(a\\) times 5 choices for \\(b\\), which equals 10.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\(a\\) can be 2 or 4, that's two options. \\(b\\) can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, that's five options. Multiplying them gives 2 * 5 = 10. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 10. I think I covered all the parts correctly: determining the evenness, the perfect square requirement, and the exponents' constraints. It's important to remember that for a factor to be even, the exponent of 2 must be at least 1, and for it to be a perfect square, the exponents must be even numbers. Also, each prime's exponent can't exceed the exponent in the original number. So, by systematically applying these rules, I arrived at the correct count of 10.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many even perfect square factors \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\) has, we analyze each prime factor's exponent constraints:\n\n1. **Even Factor**: The factor must include at least one 2, so \\(a \\geq 1\\).\n2. **Perfect Square**: Both exponents must be even. Thus, \\(a\\) must be even and \\(b\\) must be even.\n\nPossible exponents:\n- \\(a = 2, 4\\) (2 choices)\n- \\(b = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\) (5 choices)\n\nTotal even perfect square factors: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{10}",

Problem: In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where Juan is trying to compute the area of a circle, but his measurement of the diameter has an error. The actual diameter is 20 cm, and his measurement could be off by up to 20%. I need to figure out the largest possible percent error in the computed area. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, if the actual diameter is 20 cm, the actual radius is 10 cm. So, the actual area should be A = \u03c0*(10 cm)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, Juan's measurement has an error of up to 20%. That means his measured diameter could be either 20% more or 20% less than the actual diameter. Let me calculate both possibilities.\n\nIf Juan's measurement is 20% more, the measured diameter would be 20 cm + 20% of 20 cm. 20% of 20 is 4, so 20 + 4 = 24 cm. Alternatively, if his measurement is 20% less, it would be 20 cm - 4 cm = 16 cm. So, Juan's measured diameter could be either 24 cm or 16 cm.\n\nNext, I need to find out how this error in diameter affects the computed area. Since area is proportional to the square of the radius (or diameter), a percentage error in diameter would result in a percentage error in area that is approximately twice the percentage error in diameter. Wait, let me think about that again.\n\nLet me denote the actual diameter as D = 20 cm. Juan's measured diameter is D' = D \u00b1 (20% of D). So, D' = 20 \u00b1 4 cm, which is 16 cm or 24 cm. Now, the actual radius is r = D/2 = 10 cm, so Juan's measured radius is r' = D'/2. Let's compute r' for both cases.\n\nCase 1: D' = 24 cm, so r' = 24/2 = 12 cm. The computed area would be A' = \u03c0*(12 cm)\u00b2 = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nCase 2: D' = 16 cm, so r' = 16/2 = 8 cm. The computed area would be A' = \u03c0*(8 cm)\u00b2 = 64\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's compare these computed areas to the actual area of 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nCase 1: A' = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2. The error here is 144\u03c0 - 100\u03c0 = 44\u03c0 cm\u00b2. The percent error is (44\u03c0 / 100\u03c0) * 100% = 44% error.\n\nCase 2: A' = 64\u03c0 cm\u00b2. The error here is 64\u03c0 - 100\u03c0 = -36\u03c0 cm\u00b2. The percent error is (-36\u03c0 / 100\u03c0) * 100% = -36% error. But since percent error is usually expressed as a positive value, the absolute percent error is 36%.\n\nSo, the largest possible percent error in the computed area is 44% when Juan's measured diameter is 24 cm, leading to a computed area of 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2, which is 44% larger than the actual area. Conversely, when his measurement is 16 cm, the computed area is 36% smaller, but that's a smaller percent error.\n\nTherefore, the maximum percent error in the computed area is 44%.\n</think>\n\nThe largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area is 44%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Actual Diameter and Radius:**\n   - Actual diameter, \\( D = 20 \\) cm.\n   - Actual radius, \\( r = D/2 = 10 \\) cm.\n   - Actual area, \\( A = \\pi r^2 = 100\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n\n2. **Possible Juan's Measurement:**\n   - Juan's measurement error is 20% of \\( D \\).\n   - \\( 20\\% \\) of 20 cm = \\( 0.2 \\times 20 = 4 \\) cm.\n   - Juan's measured diameter, \\( D' = D \\pm 4 \\) cm = 16 cm or 24 cm.\n\n3. **Computed Areas for Each Measurement:**\n   - **Case 1:** \\( D' = 24 \\) cm.\n     - Radius, \\( r' = 24/2 = 12 \\) cm.\n     - Computed area, \\( A' = \\pi (12)^2 = 144\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n     - Error, \\( A' - A = 144\\pi - 100\\pi = 44\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n     - Percent error, \\( (44\\pi / 100\\pi) \\times 100\\% = 44\\% \\).\n\n   - **Case 2:** \\( D' = 16 \\) cm.\n     - Radius, \\( r' = 16/2 = 8 \\) cm.\n     - Computed area, \\( A' = \\pi (8)^2 = 64\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n     - Error, \\( A' - A = 64\\pi - 100\\pi = -36\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n     - Percent error, \\( (-36\\pi / 100\\pi) \\times 100\\% = -36\\% \\).

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this math problem here: What is the binomial coefficient C(n, n-1) for any positive integer n? I need to express the answer in terms of n. Hmm, binomial coefficients are the numbers you see in Pascal's triangle, right? They represent the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set. So, C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without considering the order.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for C(n, n-1). That means I need to find how many ways there are to choose n-1 elements from a set of n elements. Wait a second, isn't that the same as choosing just 1 element from the set of n? Because if you choose n-1 elements to leave out, you're essentially choosing 1 element to include. So, is C(n, n-1) equal to C(n, 1)?\n\nLet me think about this. For example, if n is 5, then C(5, 4) should be the same as C(5, 1). Calculating C(5, 4): 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (4*3*2*1 * 1) = 5. Similarly, C(5, 1) is 5! / (1! * 4!) = 5. So, in this case, they are equal. That seems to hold for another example, say n=3. C(3, 2) is 3, and C(3,1) is also 3. So, it seems that C(n, n-1) is indeed equal to C(n, 1).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The general formula for a binomial coefficient is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, plugging in k = n-1, we get C(n, n-1) = n! / ((n-1)! * (n - (n-1))!) = n! / ((n-1)! * 1!) = n! / (n-1)! = n. Because n! is n times (n-1)!, so when you divide by (n-1)!, you're left with just n.\n\nSo, C(n, n-1) simplifies to n. Therefore, the answer is n. So, for any positive integer n, the binomial coefficient C(n, n-1) is equal to n.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to interpret this? Because sometimes when you choose n-1 elements from n, it's the same as leaving out 1 element, which is the same as choosing 1 element. So, yes, that seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the symmetry property of binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficients are symmetric, meaning C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). So, if I set k = n-1, then n - k = 1, so C(n, n-1) = C(n, 1). And as we saw earlier, C(n, 1) is n. So, that's another confirmation.\n\nI think I've covered this from multiple angles: using the definition of binomial coefficients, checking specific examples, and applying the symmetry property. All these methods point to the conclusion that C(n, n-1) equals n.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident now that the answer is n. Therefore, for any positive integer n, the binomial coefficient C(n, n-1) is equal to n.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the binomial coefficient \\( \\dbinom{n}{n-1} \\) for any positive integer \\( n \\), we can use the definition of binomial coefficients and their symmetry properties.\n\n1. **Definition of Binomial Coefficient**: The binomial coefficient \\( \\dbinom{n}{k} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n   \\]\n2. **Applying the Symmetry Property**: The symmetry property of binomial coefficients states that:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dbinom{n}{n - k}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\( k = n - 1 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{n}{n - 1} = \\dbinom{n}{1}\n   \\]\n3. **Simplifying \\( \\dbinom{n}{1} \\)**: Using the definition:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{n}{1} = \\frac{n!}{1!(n - 1)!} = \\frac{n \\cdot (n - 1)!}{1 \\cdot (n - 1)!} = n\n   \\]\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, for any positive integer \\( n \\), the binomial coefficient \\( \\dbinom{n}{n - 1} \\) is equal to \\( n \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n}\n\\]",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: What is the slope of the line passing through $(-3,5)$ and $(2,-5)$? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here asking for the slope of a line that passes through two points: (-3, 5) and (2, -5). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the slope of a line is a measure of its steepness, and it's calculated by finding the change in the y-values divided by the change in the x-values between two points on the line. That makes sense because if you have two points, you can draw a line connecting them, and the slope tells you how steep that line is.\n\nSo, to be more precise, the formula for slope (m) is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nWhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two points on the line. Let me make sure I have this right. So, I need to assign the coordinates correctly. Let me label the first point as (x1, y1) and the second point as (x2, y2). So, for the first point (-3, 5), x1 is -3 and y1 is 5. For the second point (2, -5), x2 is 2 and y2 is -5.\n\nOkay, now I can plug these values into the formula. Let's compute the numerator first, which is y2 - y1. So that would be -5 - 5. Wait, that's -5 minus 5, which is -10. So, the numerator is -10.\n\nNow, the denominator is x2 - x1. So, that's 2 - (-3). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so 2 + 3 is 5. So, the denominator is 5.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the slope m is numerator divided by denominator, which is -10 divided by 5. So, m = -10 / 5 = -2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first point: x1 is -3, y1 is 5. Second point: x2 is 2, y2 is -5. So, numerator: y2 - y1 is -5 - 5, which is -10. Denominator: x2 - x1 is 2 - (-3), which is 5. So, m is -10/5, which is -2. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could visualize this. If I plot the points (-3,5) and (2,-5), the line connecting them would slope downwards from left to right, which means the slope is negative. So, a negative slope makes sense here.\n\nLet me also think about another way to compute this, just to confirm. Maybe using the rise over run method. So, if I move from (-3,5) to (2,-5), how much do I rise? That's from 5 to -5, which is a change of -10. And how much do I run? That's from -3 to 2, which is a change of 5. So, rise over run is -10/5, which is -2. Yep, same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the slope is -2. It's always good to check my work, especially when dealing with negative numbers because it's easy to mix up the signs. But in this case, both methods gave me the same answer, so I don't think I made any mistakes.\n\nAnother thing I could do is plug in the values into the slope formula again, just to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. So, y2 is -5, y1 is 5. So, -5 minus 5 is -10. x2 is 2, x1 is -3. So, 2 minus (-3) is 2 + 3, which is 5. So, -10 divided by 5 is -2. Yep, same result.\n\nAlright, I think I've thought through this problem thoroughly and checked my work multiple times. It looks like the slope is indeed -2.\n</think>\n\nThe slope of the line passing through the points (-3, 5) and (2, -5) is calculated using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm = (-5 - 5) / (2 - (-3)) = (-10) / (5) = -2\n\n**Answer:** The slope of the line is \\boxed{-2}.",

Let me start by understanding the problem and what's given.\n\nFirst, there are two congruent triangles, triangle ABC and triangle ACD. That means all corresponding sides and angles in these triangles are equal. So, AB equals AC, and AC equals AD, which I think is given because AB = AC = AD. \n\nThe problem also tells me that angle BAC is 20 degrees. So, in triangle ABC, the angle at point A is 20 degrees. Since the triangles are congruent, triangle ACD will have the same angle at point A, which is also 20 degrees.\n\nNow, I need to find angle BDC. Let me visualize this. There's point D somewhere, and I need to find the angle at point D between points B and C. So, I need to figure out the positions of points B, C, and D relative to each other.\n\nLet me try to draw this in my mind. Point A is the common vertex of both triangles. Triangle ABC has sides AB, AC, and BC, with AB = AC. Triangle ACD has sides AC, AD, and CD, with AC = AD. So, points B and D are both connected to point C and point A.\n\nSince all the triangles are congruent, the lengths of AB, AC, and AD are equal. So, AB = AC = AD. That means points B, C, and D are all equidistant from point A. So, they lie on a circle centered at point A with radius equal to AB, AC, and AD.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, points B, C, and D are all on the circumference of a circle centered at A. Therefore, triangle ABC and triangle ACD are both inscribed in this circle.\n\nGiven that angle BAC is 20 degrees, and since all the triangles are congruent, the angles at A in both triangles are equal. So, angle BAC = angle CAD = 20 degrees. That means the total angle at point A between points B and D is 40 degrees because 20 + 20 = 40.\n\nWait, no. Because angle BAC is 20 degrees, and angle CAD is also 20 degrees, so the angle at point A between points B and D is 20 + 20 = 40 degrees. So, the angle between points B and D as seen from point A is 40 degrees.\n\nNow, since points B, C, and D are on a circle centered at A, we can think about the arcs between these points. The measure of an arc in a circle is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it. So, the arc between points B and C is equal to the central angle BAC, which is 20 degrees. Similarly, the arc between points C and D is equal to the central angle CAD, which is also 20 degrees.\n\nSo, the arc from B to C is 20 degrees, and the arc from C to D is another 20 degrees, making the total arc from B to D equal to 40 degrees. Therefore, the central angle subtended by arc BD is 40 degrees.\n\nNow, we need to find angle BDC. Let me think about triangle BDC. Points B, D, and C are on the circumference of the circle centered at A. So, triangle BDC is inscribed in the same circle.\n\nTo find angle BDC, we can use the property that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, angle BDC intercepts arc BC. The measure of arc BC is 20 degrees, so angle BDC is half of that, which is 10 degrees.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is angle BDC indeed intercepting arc BC? Let me make sure. Point D is on the circumference, and we're connecting points B and D to point C. So, angle at D, which is angle BDC, is formed by points B, D, and C. So, the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite angle BDC, which is arc BC. So, yes, the measure of angle BDC is half the measure of arc BC.\n\nSince arc BC is 20 degrees, angle BDC is 10 degrees.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, points B, C, D are on the circle centered at A. The central angles BAC and CAD are each 20 degrees, so the arcs BC and CD are each 20 degrees. Therefore, the total arc from B to D is 40 degrees. Angle BDC intercepts arc BC, which is 20 degrees, so angle BDC is half of that, which is 10 degrees.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, angle BDC is 10 degrees.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm a bit confused because the problem mentions triangle ACD. So, triangle ACD is congruent to triangle ABC, which means that sides AC, AD, and CD are equal to AB, AC, and BC respectively. So, point D is such that AD equals AC, which is equal to AB, so point D is on the circle centered at A, same as points B and C.\n\nSo, point D is another point on the circumference of the circle centered at A, making the arc BD equal to 40 degrees, as we established earlier.\n\nTherefore, angle BDC is half of arc BC, which is 10 degrees. So, angle BDC is 10 degrees.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nGiven two congruent triangles ABC and ACD with AB = AC = AD, and angle BAC = 20 degrees. Since the triangles are congruent, angle CAD is also 20 degrees, making the total angle at A between points B and D equal to 40 degrees. Since points B, C, and D are on a circle centered at A, the arc BD is 40 degrees. Angle BDC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BC, which is 20 degrees, so angle BDC is half of that, which is 10 degrees.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the measure of angle BDC is 10 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe measure of angle BDC is \\boxed{10^\\circ}.\n</think>\n\nGiven two congruent triangles \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\) such that \\(AB = AC = AD\\), and \\(\\angle BAC = 20^\\circ\\).

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute the binomial coefficient, which is written as \\(\\dbinom{25}{2}\\). Hmm, let me think about what this means. I remember that the binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 25 without considering the order. So, in mathematical terms, \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

Let me see. Since \\(25! = 25 \\times 24 \\times 23!\\), I can substitute that into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23!}{2! \\times 23!}\n\\]\n\nAh, the \\(23!\\) terms cancel out from numerator and denominator, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2!}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\(2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\), this becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, let me compute \\(25 \\times 24\\). 25 multiplied by 24. Hmm, 25 times 20 is 500, and 25 times 4 is 100, so adding those together gives 600. So:\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 24 = 600\n\\]\n\nThen, divide that by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{600}{2} = 300\n\\]\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\(\\dbinom{25}{2} = 300\\).

Starting from the beginning:\n\n- The formula for binomial coefficients is correct.\n- Simplifying \\(25!\\) as \\(25 \\times 24 \\times 23!\\) is correct.\n- The \\(23!\\) terms cancel out, leaving \\(25 \\times 24\\) divided by \\(2!\\).\n- \\(25 \\times 24\\) is indeed 600, and 600 divided by 2 is 300.\n- I can also think of it another way: choosing 2 items out of 25, the first item can be any of the 25, and the second can be any of the remaining 24, but since the order doesn't matter, we have to divide by 2 to account for the duplicates. So, 25 times 24 divided by 2 is 300. That matches what I got before.\n- Alternatively, using combinations, the number of ways to choose 2 items from 25 is the same as the number of ways to leave out 23 items, which is also a valid interpretation. But that might not be as helpful here.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 300.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{25}{2}\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(n = 25\\) and \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25!}{2! \\times 23!}\n\\]\n\nSimplify by canceling \\(23!\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23!}{2! \\times 23!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2!}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(2! = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{300}\\)",

The original polynomial is given as \\(x^3 - 3x^2 + 8 = 0\\), and its roots are \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(r_3\\). I need to find a polynomial whose roots are \\(2r_1\\), \\(2r_2\\), and \\(2r_3\\). \n\nLet me recall how to transform the roots of a polynomial. If I have a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) with roots \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\), then another polynomial whose roots are \\(k r_1, k r_2, k r_3\\) can be found by substituting \\(x/k\\) into \\(P(x)\\). That makes sense because if \\(k r\\) is a root, then \\(P(k r) = 0\\), so substituting \\(x = k r\\) gives \\(P(x) = 0\\). Therefore, substituting \\(x/k\\) should give me the polynomial whose roots are scaled by \\(k\\).\n\nIn this problem, \\(k\\) is 2. So, I need to substitute \\(x/2\\) into the original polynomial \\(P(x)\\) and then simplify. Let me write that down.\n\nGiven:\n\\(P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 8\\)\n\nWe need to find \\(Q(x)\\) such that \\(Q(x) = P(x/2)\\). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, substitute \\(x/2\\) into each term of \\(P(x)\\):\n\n1. \\((x/2)^3 = x^3 / 8\\)\n2. \\(-3(x/2)^2 = -3(x^2 / 4) = -3x^2 / 4\\)\n3. \\(8\\) remains 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\(Q(x) = (x^3 / 8) - (3x^2 / 4) + 8\\)\n\nNow, this is a polynomial, but it's not monic yet because the leading coefficient is \\(1/8\\). To make it monic, I need to multiply the entire polynomial by 8. Let me do that.\n\nMultiplying each term by 8:\n\n1. \\(8*(x^3 / 8) = x^3\\)\n2. \\(8*(-3x^2 / 4) = -6x^2\\)\n3. \\(8*8 = 64\\)\n\nSo, after multiplying, the polynomial becomes:\n\n\\(x^3 - 6x^2 + 64\\)\n\nWait a second, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, substituting \\(x/2\\) into \\(P(x)\\):\n\n- The first term: \\((x/2)^3 = x^3 / 8\\)\n- The second term: \\(-3*(x/2)^2 = -3*(x^2 / 4) = -3x^2 / 4\\)\n- The third term: 8 remains 8.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\n\\(x^3 / 8 - 3x^2 / 4 + 8\\)\n\nMultiplying by 8:\n\n- \\(8*(x^3 / 8) = x^3\\)\n- \\(8*(-3x^2 / 4) = -6x^2\\)\n- \\(8*8 = 64\\)\n\nSo, the resulting polynomial is indeed \\(x^3 - 6x^2 + 64\\). \n\nLet me just verify this by considering a specific root. Suppose \\(r_1\\) is a root of the original polynomial, so \\(r_1^3 - 3r_1^2 + 8 = 0\\). Then, \\(2r_1\\) should be a root of \\(Q(x)\\). Let's compute \\(Q(2r_1)\\):\n\n\\(Q(2r_1) = (2r_1)^3 - 6(2r_1)^2 + 64\\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\((2r_1)^3 = 8r_1^3\\)\n2. \\(-6(2r_1)^2 = -6*4r_1^2 = -24r_1^2\\)\n3. \\(64\\) remains 64\n\nSo, \\(Q(2r_1) = 8r_1^3 - 24r_1^2 + 64\\)\n\nFactor out 8 from the first two terms:\n\n\\(8(r_1^3 - 3r_1^2) + 64\\)\n\nBut from the original polynomial, \\(r_1^3 - 3r_1^2 = -8\\), so substitute that in:\n\n\\(8*(-8) + 64 = -64 + 64 = 0\\)\n\nWhich confirms that \\(2r_1\\) is indeed a root of \\(Q(x)\\). The same reasoning applies to \\(2r_2\\) and \\(2r_3\\), so this polynomial is correctly derived.\n\nTherefore, the monic polynomial whose roots are \\(2r_1\\), \\(2r_2\\), and \\(2r_3\\) is \\(x^3 - 6x^2 + 64\\).\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem to solve: Calculate (-1)^47 + 2^{(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2)}. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me start by understanding each part of the expression separately.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first term: (-1)^47. I know that when you raise a negative number to an exponent, the result alternates between negative and positive depending on whether the exponent is odd or even. So, since 47 is an odd number, (-1)^47 should be -1. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nNow, moving on to the second term: 2^{(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2)}. This part looks more complicated because it's an exponent with an exponent in the power. I'll need to solve the innermost parentheses first and then work my way outwards. Let me tackle each of these parts one by one.\n\nStarting with 3^3. I know that 3 cubed means 3 multiplied by itself three times, so 3 * 3 * 3. Let me calculate that: 3 * 3 is 9, and then 9 * 3 is 27. So, 3^3 equals 27.\n\nNext, let's look at 4^2. That's 4 squared, which is 4 multiplied by itself once. So, 4 * 4 is 16. Therefore, 4^2 is 16.\n\nNow, 6^2 is 6 squared. 6 multiplied by itself is 6 * 6, which is 36. So, 6^2 is 36.\n\nNow, putting it all together inside the parentheses: 3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2 is 27 + 16 - 36. Let me compute that step by step. First, 27 + 16 is 43. Then, 43 - 36 is 7. So, the entire exponent in the second term simplifies to 7.\n\nTherefore, the second term becomes 2^7. I know that 2 raised to the 7th power is 128 because 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, and 2^7 is 128. So, 2^7 is 128.\n\nNow, putting it all together: the first term is (-1)^47, which is -1, and the second term is 128. So, adding them together: -1 + 128. That should be 127, right? Because 128 minus 1 is 127.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to mix up exponents or arithmetic errors, especially with multiple operations.\n\nStarting again: (-1)^47. Since 47 is odd, it's -1. That's correct.\n\nNext, the exponent in the second term: 3^3 is 27, 4^2 is 16, 6^2 is 36. Adding 27 and 16 gives 43, subtracting 36 gives 7. So, 2^7 is 128. That's correct.\n\nAdding -1 and 128: -1 + 128 is indeed 127. So, the final answer should be 127.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the order of operations or anything like that. Sometimes, especially with exponents, it's easy to misapply the rules.\n\nThe second term is 2 raised to the power of (3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2). So, the operations inside the parentheses are addition and subtraction, which are evaluated from left to right, so that's 27 + 16 - 36. That's 43 - 36, which is 7. So, the exponent is 7, and 2^7 is 128. That seems right.\n\nAdding that to (-1)^47, which is -1, gives 127. That all checks out.\n\nI think I've got this right. The answer is 127.\n</think>\n\nThe expression to evaluate is $(-1)^{47} + 2^{(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2)}$. \n\nFirst, calculate $(-1)^{47}$. Since 47 is odd, this equals -1.\n\nNext, simplify the exponent in the second term:\n- $3^3 = 27$\n- $4^2 = 16$\n- $6^2 = 36$\n\nCombine these: $27 + 16 - 36 = 7$. Therefore, the second term is $2^7 = 128$.\n\nAdding the two parts together: $-1 + 128 = 127$.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{127}",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this equation: (m - 4)^3 equals (1/8) to the power of -1. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I should probably figure out what (1/8)^{-1} is because that seems like the easier part. \n\nWait, exponents can sometimes be tricky. Remember, when you have a negative exponent, it's the same as taking the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent. So, (1/8)^{-1} would be the same as 1 divided by (1/8), right? Let me calculate that. 1 divided by (1/8) is the same as multiplying 1 by 8, which gives me 8. So, (1/8)^{-1} equals 8. \n\nAlright, so now the equation simplifies to (m - 4)^3 = 8. Now, I need to solve for m. Since the equation is in the form of something cubed equals 8, I can take the cube root of both sides to get rid of the exponent. \n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, I get m - 4 equals the cube root of 8. Now, what's the cube root of 8? Well, 2 times 2 times 2 is 8, so the cube root of 8 is 2. Therefore, m - 4 equals 2. \n\nNow, to solve for m, I just need to add 4 to both sides of the equation. So, m - 4 + 4 equals 2 + 4, which simplifies to m equals 6. \n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by simplifying (1/8)^{-1} to 8, which seems correct. Then, I took the cube root of both sides to get m - 4 = 2, which is right because 2 cubed is 8. Finally, adding 4 to both sides gives me m = 6. \n\nI think that's all there is to it. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that m equals 6 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( m \\) in the equation \\((m - 4)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the right side**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1} = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the equation with the simplified right side**:\n   \\[\n   (m - 4)^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Take the cube root of both sides**:\n   \\[\n   m - 4 = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( m \\)**:\n   \\[\n   m = 2 + 4 = 6\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{6}\\)",

    "generated_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. Put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many distinct positive factors does 32 have? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many distinct positive factors 32 has. Hmm, factors are numbers that divide into 32 without leaving a remainder, right? So, I should start by listing out all the factors of 32 and then count them. But maybe there's a smarter way than just listing them all out. Let me think.\n\nI remember something about prime factorization. If I can express 32 as a product of prime numbers, maybe I can use that to find the number of factors. Let me try that. 32 divided by 2 is 16, then 16 divided by 2 is 8, 8 divided by 2 is 4, 4 divided by 2 is 2, and finally 2 divided by 2 is 1. So, that means 32 is 2 to the 5th power, or 2\u2075. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, I think there's a formula for the number of factors based on the exponents in the prime factorization. If a number N can be expressed as N = p\u2081^a\u2081 * p\u2082^a\u2082 * ... * p\u2099^a\u2099, where p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099 are prime numbers and a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 are their respective exponents, then the number of distinct positive factors of N is (a\u2081 + 1)*(a\u2082 + 1)*...*(a\u2099 + 1). \n\nSo, applying that to 32, which is 2\u2075, the number of factors would be (5 + 1) = 6. Let me check that. If 32 is 2\u2075, then its factors are 2\u2070, 2\u00b9, 2\u00b2, 2\u00b3, 2\u2074, and 2\u2075, which are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. That's six factors in total. Yep, that seems right.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any factors. Sometimes when listing factors, you might overlook something. Let's see: 1 is a factor, 2 is a factor, 4 is a factor, 8 is a factor, 16 is a factor, and 32 is a factor. That's six factors, so I didn't miss any. Good.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. Using the prime factorization method, I can confidently say that 32 has six distinct positive factors. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many distinct positive factors 32 has, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:  \n   32 can be expressed as \\(2^5\\).\n\n2. **Number of Factors Formula**:  \n   For a number \\(N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_n^{a_n}\\), the number of distinct positive factors is \\((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\ldots (a_n + 1)\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Formula**:  \n   Here, \\(N = 32 = 2^5\\), so the number of factors is \\(5 + 1 = 6\\).\n\n4. **Verification**:  \n   Listing the factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length. That means if I can find the length of one side, I can just multiply it by three to get the perimeter. That makes sense because perimeter is the total length around the shape, so adding up all the sides gives me that total.\n\nNow, the problem gives me the base of the triangle as 8 meters. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so that means the base is 8 meters, and the other two sides are also 8 meters each. So, the perimeter would just be 8 + 8 + 8. Let me write that down to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\n8 (base) + 8 (one side) + 8 (other side) = 24 meters. So, the perimeter should be 24 meters. That seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes in geometry problems, especially with triangles, there might be a trick or a hidden detail that I'm not considering. For example, maybe the triangle isn't equilateral because of some other property, but no, the problem clearly states it's an equilateral triangle.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the given base is the same as the side length. Since it's an equilateral triangle, the base is the same as the other sides, so yes, the base is 8 meters, and the sides are also 8 meters each. So, adding them up gives me 24 meters for the perimeter.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me visualize the triangle. The Asymptote code draws the triangle with coordinates (0,0), (8,0), and (4, 4\u221a3). So, the base is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (8,0), which is 8 meters. The other two sides connect (8,0) to (4, 4\u221a3) and (4, 4\u221a3) back to (0,0). \n\nCalculating the length of one of these sides, for example, between (0,0) and (4, 4\u221a3), using the distance formula: \u221a[(4-0)^2 + (4\u221a3 - 0)^2] = \u221a[16 + 48] = \u221a64 = 8. So, that confirms that each side is indeed 8 meters, and the perimeter is 24 meters. \n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The triangle is equilateral, so all sides are equal. The base is given as 8 meters, so each side is 8 meters. Adding them up gives the perimeter as 24 meters. The coordinate system also confirms that each side is 8 meters, which solidifies my answer.\n\nSo, I'm pretty sure now that the perimeter is 24 meters. There's no trick here because it's a straightforward equilateral triangle problem. Just ensuring that I didn't overlook any hidden information or properties that might complicate things, but in this case, everything lines up perfectly.\n\nIn summary, since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, knowing one side allows me to find all sides and thus the perimeter. Given the base is 8 meters, each side is 8 meters, leading to a perimeter of 24 meters.\n</think>\n\nThe perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 24 meters.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the type of triangle**: The given triangle is equilateral, meaning all three sides are equal in length.\n\n2. **Given information**: The base of the triangle is 8 meters.\n\n3. **Determine the length of the sides**: Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, each side is 8 meters.\n\n4. **Calculate the perimeter**: Perimeter is the sum of all sides.

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 6:44. Hmm, let's start by visualizing the clock. At 6:00, the hour hand is exactly on the 6, and the minute hand is on the 12, right? But at 6:44, the minute hand has moved past the 12. \n\nFirst, I should determine where each hand is at 6:44. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the minute hand: Since there are 60 minutes in a hour, each minute represents 6 degrees (because 360 degrees divided by 60 minutes equals 6 degrees per minute). So, for 44 minutes, the minute hand has moved 44 times 6 degrees. Let me calculate that: 44 * 6 = 264 degrees. So, the minute hand is at 264 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nNow, the hour hand: At 6:00, the hour hand is at 180 degrees (since 6 * 30 = 180, because each hour mark is 30 degrees apart). But since it's 6:44, the hour hand has moved past the 6 towards the 7. I need to figure out how much it has moved.\n\nEach hour is 60 minutes, so each minute, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (since 30 degrees divided by 60 minutes equals 0.5 degrees per minute). Therefore, in 44 minutes, the hour hand has moved 44 * 0.5 = 22 degrees past the 6. So, the total position of the hour hand is 180 + 22 = 202 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nNow, I have both positions: the minute hand at 264 degrees and the hour hand at 202 degrees. To find the angle between them, I subtract the smaller angle from the larger one: 264 - 202 = 62 degrees. \n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But the question asks for the acute angle formed by the hands. Since 62 degrees is already acute (as it's less than 90 degrees), I don't need to subtract it from 180 or anything. \n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nMinute hand: 44 minutes * 6 degrees per minute = 264 degrees. Correct.\n\nHour hand: 44 minutes * 0.5 degrees per minute = 22 degrees. Added to the initial 180 degrees gives 202 degrees. Correct.\n\nDifference: 264 - 202 = 62 degrees. Correct.\n\nSo, the acute angle is 62 degrees. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of degrees in the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 6:44 is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Minute Hand Position**: At 44 minutes, the minute hand is at 44 * 6 = 264 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n2. **Hour Hand Position**: At 6:44, the hour hand has moved 44 * 0.5 = 22 degrees past the 6. Thus, its position is 6 * 30 + 22 = 202 degrees.\n3. **Angle Between Hands**: Subtract the smaller position from the larger one: 264 - 202 = 62 degrees.\n4.

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this math problem here about Sarah and Greg's bowling scores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe problem says that Sarah's score was 40 points more than Greg's. So, if I let Greg's score be some number, say G, then Sarah's score would be G plus 40. That makes sense because it's 40 points more than Greg's.\n\nNext, it says that the average of their two scores was 102. Hmm, the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. So, if I add Sarah's score and Greg's score together and then divide by 2, that should equal 102.\n\nLet me write that down as an equation. So, (Sarah's score + Greg's score) / 2 = 102. But I already know that Sarah's score is Greg's score plus 40. So, I can substitute Sarah's score in the equation with G + 40.\n\nPutting that into the equation, it becomes (G + 40 + G) / 2 = 102. Let me simplify that numerator. G plus G is 2G, and then plus 40. So, it's (2G + 40) / 2 = 102.\n\nNow, I can simplify that further. Dividing both terms in the numerator by 2, I get G + 20 = 102. Because 2G divided by 2 is G, and 40 divided by 2 is 20. So, that simplifies to G + 20 = 102.\n\nTo find Greg's score, I need to solve for G. I can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation. So, G = 102 - 20. That gives me G = 82. So, Greg's score is 82.\n\nBut the problem asks for Sarah's score, which is 40 points more than Greg's. So, Sarah's score is G + 40, which is 82 + 40. Let me add that up. 80 plus 40 is 120, and then plus 2 more is 122. So, Sarah's score is 122.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If Greg has 82, then Sarah has 82 plus 40, which is indeed 122. Then, the average of their scores is (82 + 122) / 2. Let's add those: 82 plus 122 is 204. Divide that by 2, and we get 102. Which matches the problem's statement.

What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is about a standard deck of 52 cards. The deck is arranged randomly, and I need to find the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black. \n\nAlright, so let me break this down. First, I need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when dealing with two cards from the deck. Then, I'll figure out how many of those outcomes meet the condition where the first card is red and the second is black. Finally, I'll divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes to get the probability.\n\nLet me start by recalling that in a standard deck, there are 52 cards. These are divided into four suits: two are black (spades and clubs), and two are red (hearts and diamonds). Each suit has 13 cards, with one of each rank. The ranks are from Ace through King, totaling 13 ranks per suit.\n\nNow, the deck is randomly arranged, so the order of the cards is random. I need to find the probability that the first card is red and the second is black. \n\nTo approach this, I'll consider the probability of each event happening in sequence. The first event is picking a red card as the first card, and the second event is picking a black card as the second card, given that the first card was red.\n\nLet me define the two events:\n\nEvent A: The first card is red.\nEvent B: The second card is black.\n\nI need to find the probability of both A and B occurring in sequence, which is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nSo, let's compute P(A) first. The probability that the first card is red is the number of red cards divided by the total number of cards. There are 26 red cards in the deck (13 hearts and 13 diamonds), and 52 cards in total. So, P(A) = 26/52, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, I need to find P(B|A), the probability that the second card is black given that the first card was red. \n\nAfter the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck. Since the first card was red, there are still 26 red cards left in the remaining 51 cards. However, the number of black cards remains unchanged at 26. \n\nWait, let me think about that again. If the first card was red, then the remaining 51 cards consist of 25 red cards and 26 black cards. So, the probability that the second card is black is 26/51.\n\nTherefore, P(B|A) = 26/51.\n\nNow, multiplying P(A) and P(B|A) gives the probability of both events occurring in sequence: (1/2) * (26/51).\n\nLet me compute that: (1/2) * (26/51) = 26/102. \n\nSimplifying 26/102 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 13/51.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 26 divided by 102 is indeed 13/51, because 26*2=52 and 102*2=204, so 52/204 simplifies to 13/51. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black is 13/51.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss anything in the problem statement. The deck is randomly arranged, which I accounted for by considering the probabilities step by step without assuming any specific arrangement. \n\nAnother way to approach this problem is by considering the total number of favorable permutations and dividing by the total number of possible permutations. \n\nThe total number of possible permutations for two cards is 52 * 51, since the first card can be any of the 52, and the second card can be any of the remaining 51.\n\nThe number of favorable permutations is the number of ways to choose a red card first and a black card second. There are 26 red cards and 26 black cards. So, the number of favorable permutations is 26 * 26.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (26 * 26) / (52 * 51).\n\nCalculating that: 26 * 26 = 676, and 52 * 51 = 2652.\n\nSo, 676 / 2652 simplifies to 13/51, which matches the earlier result.\n\nYes, that confirms that the probability is indeed 13/51.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the top card is red and the second card is black is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Total number of possible outcomes for two cards**: 52 * 51 = 2652.\n\n2. **Number of favorable outcomes**: 26 red cards * 26 black cards = 676.\n\n3. **Probability**: 676 / 2652 = 13/51.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}",

Problem: Find the point where the line passing through $(3,4,1)$ and $(5,1,6)$ intersects the $xy$-plane. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find where the line passing through the points (3,4,1) and (5,1,6) intersects the xy-plane. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the xy-plane is where the z-coordinate is zero. So, any point on the xy-plane has the form (x, y, 0). Therefore, I need to find the point where the given line intersects this plane, meaning the z-coordinate will be zero there.\n\nTo find the equation of the line passing through two points in three-dimensional space, I can use parametric equations. Let me denote the two points as P1 = (3,4,1) and P2 = (5,1,6). \n\nLet me write the parametric equations for the line. Let's say the parameter is t, which goes from 0 to 1 as we move from P1 to P2.\n\nSo, the parametric equations would be:\nx = 3 + (5 - 3)t = 3 + 2t\ny = 4 + (1 - 4)t = 4 - 3t\nz = 1 + (6 - 1)t = 1 + 5t\n\nYes, that looks right. So, as t varies from 0 to 1, we move from P1 to P2.\n\nNow, I need to find the value of t where z = 0, because that's when the line intersects the xy-plane.\n\nSo, setting z = 0:\n1 + 5t = 0\nSolving for t:\n5t = -1\nt = -1/5\n\nWait, t is negative here. That means the point where the line intersects the xy-plane is not between P1 and P2 but in the opposite direction beyond P1.\n\nSo, the point is at t = -1/5. Let's plug this back into the parametric equations for x and y.\n\nCalculating x:\nx = 3 + 2*(-1/5) = 3 - 2/5 = (15/5 - 2/5) = 13/5\n\nCalculating y:\ny = 4 - 3*(-1/5) = 4 + 3/5 = (20/5 + 3/5) = 23/5\n\nSo, the point of intersection is (13/5, 23/5, 0).\n\nLet me check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFor x:\n3 + 2*(-1/5) = 3 - 2/5 = 13/5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor y:\n4 - 3*(-1/5) = 4 + 3/5 = 23/5. Correct.\n\nAnd z is 0, so it's indeed on the xy-plane.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using vectors.\n\nThe direction vector of the line is P2 - P1, which is (5-3, 1-4, 6-1) = (2, -3, 5). So, direction vector is (2, -3, 5).\n\nParametric equations are:\nx = 3 + 2t\ny = 4 - 3t\nz = 1 + 5t\n\nSame as before. So, setting z=0 gives t=-1/5. Then, plugging back into x and y gives (13/5, 23/5, 0). So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the intersection point in terms of parameters.\n\nLet me denote the two points as A = (3,4,1) and B = (5,1,6).\n\nLet\u2019s write the parametric equations as:\nA + t(B - A) = (3 + 2t, 4 - 3t, 1 + 5t)\n\nSet z=0:\n1 + 5t = 0 \u2192 t = -1/5\n\nPlug t into x and y:\nx = 3 + 2*(-1/5) = 3 - 2/5 = 13/5\ny = 4 - 3*(-1/5) = 4 + 3/5 = 23/5\n\nSame result. So, I think it's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I can be confident that the point is (13/5, 23/5, 0).\n</think>\n\nTo find the point where the line passing through (3,4,1) and (5,1,6) intersects the xy-plane, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parametrize the line**: Use a parameter \\( t \\) to express the line as:\n   \\[\n   x = 3 + 2t, \\quad y = 4 - 3t, \\quad z = 1 + 5t\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( t \\) varies from 0 to 1 to move from point (3,4,1) to (5,1,6).\n\n2. **Find \\( t \\) when \\( z = 0 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 5t = 0 \\implies t = -\\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n   This value of \\( t \\) indicates the point of intersection is beyond (3,4,1) in the opposite direction.\n\n3. **Calculate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) at \\( t = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = 3 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 3 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 4 - 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 4 + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{23}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Intersection point**:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{13}{5}, \\frac{23}{5}, 0 \\right)\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{13}{5}, \\frac{23}{5}, 0 \\right)}",

Let me break it down step by step because I don't want to make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the function f(x) does. It takes an input x, squares it, subtracts 2 times x, and that's the output. So f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x. Maybe I can write this as f(x) = x(x - 2) to see if that helps visualize anything.\n\nNow, the problem is to apply this function f six times starting with the input -1. So, f(f(f(f(f(f(-1))))))). That's six layers deep. Let me tackle this one step at a time.\n\nStarting with the innermost function: f(-1). Let's compute that first.\n\nf(-1) = (-1)\u00b2 - 2*(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nOkay, so f(-1) is 3. That means the next layer is f(3).\n\nf(3) = (3)\u00b2 - 2*(3) = 9 - 6 = 3.\n\nWait, f(3) is also 3? That's interesting. So, if I plug 3 into f, I get 3 again. That means once I reach 3, all subsequent applications of f will keep giving me 3. So, f(f(3)) = f(3) = 3, and so on.\n\nSo, from this point, all the remaining applications of f will just be 3. Let's see how many layers we have after f(-1). The original problem is f(f(f(f(f(f(-1))))))). Let's count the number of f's:\n\n1. f(-1)\n2. f(3)\n3. f(3)\n4. f(3)\n5. f(3)\n6. f(3)\n\nSo, after the first f(-1) which gives 3, we have five more f(3) applications. But as we saw, once we get to f(3) = 3, all subsequent f's will also give 3. So, regardless of how many times we apply f after that, we'll just stay at 3.\n\nTherefore, the value of f(f(f(f(f(f(-1))))))) is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nStarting with f(-1):\n\nf(-1) = (-1)\u00b2 - 2*(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nThen f(3):\n\nf(3) = (3)\u00b2 - 2*(3) = 9 - 6 = 3. Correct.\n\nSo, f(3) = 3. Correct.\n\nSo, f(f(-1)) = f(3) = 3. Then, f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) = 3. And so on for each additional f.\n\nSince there are six f's in total, starting with f(-1), and then five more f's, but after the first f(-1) which gives 3, all the subsequent f's will just stay at 3. So, the final result is 3.\n\nI think that's solid.

First, I remember that if two square roots are equal, then their radicands (the expressions inside the square roots) must be equal. So, I can set the inside parts equal to each other. Let me write that down:\n\n\u221a(1 + \u221a(2y - 3)) = \u221a6\n\nIf I square both sides, that should eliminate the outer square root.

Problem: Determine the sum of all single-digit replacements for $z$ such that the number ${24{,}z38}$ is divisible by 6. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of all single-digit replacements for z such that the number 24,z38 is divisible by 6. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. So, I need to make sure that 24,z38 is divisible by both 2 and 3. That means I'll have to check the divisibility rules for 2 and 3 separately and then combine the conditions.\n\nStarting with the divisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. In this case, the last digit is 8, which is even. So, regardless of what z is, as long as the last digit is 8, the number will be divisible by 2. That means z can be any digit from 0 to 9 without violating the divisibility by 2 condition. But I also need to consider the divisibility by 3.\n\nNext, let's look at the divisibility by 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. So, I need to calculate the sum of the digits of 24,z38 and see what conditions that imposes on z.\n\nThe digits of the number are: 2, 4, z, 3, and 8. Let's add them up:\n\n2 + 4 + z + 3 + 8 = (2 + 4) + (z) + (3 + 8) = 6 + z + 11 = 17 + z.\n\nSo, the sum of the digits is 17 + z. For the number to be divisible by 3, 17 + z must be a multiple of 3. That means 17 + z \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nNow, let's figure out what z can be. Since z is a single-digit replacement, it can be from 0 to 9. Let's find the values of z such that 17 + z is divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, let's compute 17 mod 3 to simplify the equation. 17 divided by 3 is 5 with a remainder of 2, so 17 \u2261 2 mod 3. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n2 + z \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nz \u2261 -2 mod 3.\n\nBut since we're working with mod 3, -2 is equivalent to 1 (because 3 - 2 = 1). So, z \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nThis means that z can be any digit from 0 to 9 that is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Let's list those digits:\n\n1, 4, 7.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. Starting from 0:\n\n0: 0 mod 3 = 0\n1: 1 mod 3 = 1\n2: 2 mod 3 = 2\n3: 3 mod 3 = 0\n4: 4 mod 3 = 1\n5: 5 mod 3 = 2\n6: 6 mod 3 = 0\n7: 7 mod 3 = 1\n8: 8 mod 3 = 2\n9: 9 mod 3 = 0\n\nSo, the digits that are congruent to 1 mod 3 are indeed 1, 4, 7.\n\nTherefore, the possible single-digit replacements for z are 1, 4, and 7.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of all such single-digit replacements. So, let's add them up:\n\n1 + 4 + 7 = 12.\n\nSo, the sum of all single-digit replacements for z is 12.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible values of z. Let's think again.\n\nWe had 17 + z \u2261 0 mod 3, which simplifies to z \u2261 1 mod 3. So, in the range from 0 to 9, the numbers that satisfy this are 1, 4, 7. That's correct. There are no other numbers in this range that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of z are indeed 1, 4, and 7, and their sum is 12.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 12.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the sum of all single-digit replacements for \\( z \\) such that the number \\( 24{,}z38 \\) is divisible by 6, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: The last digit is 8, which is even. Hence, \\( z \\) can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. The sum of the digits of \\( 24{,}z38 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 + z + 3 + 8 = 17 + z\n   \\]\n   For \\( 17 + z \\) to be divisible by 3:\n   \\[\n   17 + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( 17 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   2 + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies z \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n   \\]\n   The digits \\( z \\) that satisfy this are 1, 4, and 7.\n\n3. **Sum of Possible \\( z \\) Values**: Adding these values:\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 + 7 = 12\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{12}",

Problem: What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the area of a regular hexagon that's inscribed in a circle. The area of the circle is given as 324\u03c0 square units. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since I know the area is 324\u03c0, I can set up the equation \u03c0r\u00b2 = 324\u03c0. If I divide both sides by \u03c0, that cancels out the \u03c0 terms, leaving me with r\u00b2 = 324. To find the radius, I take the square root of both sides, so r = \u221a324. Calculating that, \u221a324 is 18, because 18 times 18 is 324. So, the radius of the circle is 18 units.\n\nNow, the regular hexagon is inscribed in this circle. I recall that in a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, all the vertices lie on the circumference, and the sides are equal in length. For a regular hexagon, each side is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. Wait, is that right? Let me think. In a regular hexagon, each side is actually equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. So, in this case, since the circle has a radius of 18, each side of the hexagon should also be 18 units long.\n\nNow, I need to find the area of this regular hexagon. I remember that there's a formula for the area of a regular hexagon, which is something like (3\u221a3 / 2) times the side length squared. Let me write that down: Area = (3\u221a3 / 2) * s\u00b2, where s is the side length. Since I found that s = 18, I can plug that into the formula.\n\nSo, substituting s = 18, the area becomes (3\u221a3 / 2) * (18)\u00b2. Calculating 18 squared, that's 324. So now, the area is (3\u221a3 / 2) * 324. Let me compute that step by step. First, 324 divided by 2 is 162. Then, multiplying that by 3\u221a3 gives 162 * 3\u221a3. 162 times 3 is 486, so the area is 486\u221a3 square units.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. The formula for the area of a regular hexagon is indeed (3\u221a3 / 2) * s\u00b2. So, plugging in s = 18, we get (3\u221a3 / 2) * (18)\u00b2. 18 squared is 324, correct. 324 divided by 2 is 162, right. Then, 162 multiplied by 3 is 486, so 486\u221a3. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about the regular hexagon as being composed of six equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the radius of the circle. Since each triangle has an area of (\u221a3 / 4) * s\u00b2, and there are six of them, the total area would be 6 * (\u221a3 / 4) * s\u00b2. That simplifies to (3\u221a3 / 2) * s\u00b2, which is the same formula as before. So, that confirms that my answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular hexagon inscribed in the circle with an area of 324\u03c0 square units is 486\u221a3 square units.\n</think>\n\nTo find the area of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle with an area of \\(324\\pi\\) square units, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the radius of the circle:**\n   - The area of the circle is given by \\(A = \\pi r^2\\).\n   - Substitute \\(A = 324\\pi\\):\n     \\[\n     \\pi r^2 = 324\\pi \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r^2 = 324 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = 18 \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Relate the radius to the side length of the hexagon:**\n   - In a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, each side is equal to the radius of the circle.\n   - Therefore, the side length \\(s = 18\\) units.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the regular hexagon:**\n   - The area \\(A\\) of a regular hexagon with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(s = 18\\):\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 18^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 324\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     A = 162 \\times 3\\sqrt{3} = 486\\sqrt{3} \\text{ square units}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{486\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]",

Problem: Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so Cameron is working on multiples of 20, and we need to figure out how many integers are in his list. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Cameron writes down three things: the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube, and then all the multiples of 20 between them. Then, we have to find how many integers are in that list.\n\nSo, let's start with the first part: the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer, like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. So, we need to find the smallest number that is both a multiple of 20 and a perfect square.\n\nTo do this, I think we can look at the prime factors of 20 and see what needs to be added to make it a perfect square. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5^1. For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. So, 2^2 is already fine because the exponent is 2, which is even. But 5^1 has an exponent of 1, which is odd. So, to make it a perfect square, we need to multiply by another 5 to make it 5^2. That way, both exponents become even: 2^2 * 5^2, which is 100.\n\nSo, the smallest multiple of 20 that's a perfect square is 100.\n\nNext, Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube. A perfect cube is a number that's the cube of an integer, like 1, 8, 27, 64, etc. So, we need the smallest multiple of 20 that's also a perfect cube.\n\nAgain, we'll look at the prime factors of 20, which are 2^2 * 5^1. For a perfect cube, each exponent in the prime factorization must be a multiple of 3. So, let's see: 2^2 is already close because 2 is less than 3, but 5^1 is also less than 3. So, to make both exponents multiples of 3, we need to multiply by 2^(1) to make 2^(2+1)=2^3 and by 5^(2) to make 5^(1+2)=5^3. That way, both exponents are 3, which is a multiple of 3, so the resulting number is a perfect cube.\n\nSo, we multiply 20 by 2^1 * 5^2, which is 2*25=50. So, 20*50=1000.\n\nWait, but 20*50 is 1000, which is indeed a perfect cube because 10^3 is 1000. So, that checks out.\n\nSo, the smallest multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube is 1000.\n\nNow, Cameron writes down all the multiples of 20 between these two numbers, 100 and 1000. So, we need to find how many multiples of 20 are there from 100 up to 1000, inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.\n\nHere, the first term is 100, the last term is 1000, and the common difference is 20 because we're dealing with multiples of 20.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: n = ((1000 - 100) / 20) + 1.\n\nCalculating the numerator: 1000 - 100 = 900.\n\nDivide by 20: 900 / 20 = 45.\n\nAdd 1: 45 + 1 = 46.\n\nSo, there are 46 multiples of 20 between 100 and 1000, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, Cameron's list has 46 integers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many integers are in Cameron's list, we first identify the smallest positive multiples of 20 that are perfect squares and perfect cubes, respectively.\n\n1. **Smallest Perfect Square Multiple of 20:**\n   - Prime factorization of 20: \\(2^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n   - To make it a perfect square, exponents must be even. Thus, multiply by \\(5^1\\) to get \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 = 100\\).\n\n2. **Smallest Perfect Cube Multiple of 20:**\n   - Prime factorization of 20: \\(2^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n   - To make it a perfect cube, exponents must be multiples of 3.

What is the probability of the arrow stopping in region $C$?  Express your answer as a common fraction. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a board game spinner. It's divided into four regions: A, B, C, and D. The probabilities given are for A, B, and C, and D is equal to C. I need to find the probability of the spinner stopping on region C.\n\nFirst, I remember that the total probability for all regions on the spinner should add up to 1. That makes sense because the spinner must land on one of the regions eventually. So, if I can express all the probabilities in terms of the unknowns and set up an equation that sums to 1, I can solve for the unknown.\n\nThe problem gives me the probability for A as 3/8, for B as 1/4, and for C and D as equal. Since C and D are equal, their probabilities are the same. Let me denote the probability for C as x. Then, the probability for D is also x.\n\nSo, now I can write the total probability as the sum of A, B, C, and D:\n\nP(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) = 1\n\nSubstituting the known values and the variable x:\n\n3/8 + 1/4 + x + x = 1\n\nNow, I need to combine these fractions and solve for x. Let me first find a common denominator for the fractions 3/8 and 1/4. The denominators are 8 and 4, so the least common denominator is 8.\n\nI can convert 1/4 to eighths. Since 1/4 is equal to 2/8, I can write:\n\n3/8 + 2/8 + x + x = 1\n\nNow, adding 3/8 and 2/8 together gives me 5/8:\n\n5/8 + x + x = 1\n\nCombining the x terms:\n\n5/8 + 2x = 1\n\nNow, I need to isolate 2x. I can subtract 5/8 from both sides:\n\n2x = 1 - 5/8\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n1 is equal to 8/8, so 8/8 - 5/8 = 3/8.\n\nSo, 2x = 3/8\n\nTo solve for x, I divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = (3/8) / 2\n\nDividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by 1/2:\n\nx = (3/8) * (1/2) = 3/16\n\nSo, the probability of the arrow stopping in region C is 3/16.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning, the total probability is 1. Adding up A (3/8), B (1/4 which is 2/8), C (x), and D (x). That gives 3/8 + 2/8 + x + x = 1. So, 5/8 + 2x = 1. Subtract 5/8 from both sides: 2x = 3/8. Divide both sides by 2: x = 3/16. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate all probabilities and ensure they add up to 1. So, 3/8 is 0.375, 1/4 is 0.25, C and D are each 3/16, which is 0.1875. Adding them up: 0.375 + 0.25 = 0.625, then 0.1875 + 0.1875 = 0.375. Adding 0.625 and 0.375 gives 1.0. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the probability of stopping on region C is 3/16.\n</think>\n\nThe probability of the arrow stopping in region C is 3/16.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet the probability of stopping in region C be \\( x \\). Since the probability of stopping in region D is equal to that in C, the probability for D is also \\( x \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Probability for A: \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)\n- Probability for B: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n- Probability for C: \\( x \\)\n- Probability for D: \\( x \\)\n\nTotal probability must sum to 1:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + x + x = 1\n\\]\n\nConvert \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to eighths:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + x + x = 1\n\\]\n\nCombine fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} + 2x = 1\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n2x = 1 - \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The probability of the arrow stopping in region C is \\( \\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}} \\).",

That might make it easier to find the tangent value.\n\nLet me calculate how many \u03c0 are in 9\u03c0/4. Well, 9 divided by 4 is 2.25. So 9\u03c0/4 is 2\u03c0 plus 0.25\u03c0, right? Because 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, and 8\u03c0/4 plus \u03c0/4 is 9\u03c0/4. So that means 9\u03c0/4 is equal to 2\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since tangent has a period of \u03c0, subtracting 2\u03c0 from 9\u03c0/4 would give me \u03c0/4. So tan(9\u03c0/4) is the same as tan(\u03c0/4). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So if I subtract 2\u03c0 from 9\u03c0/4, I get 9\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4. So yes, that makes sense. Therefore, tan(9\u03c0/4) = tan(\u03c0/4). \n\nNow, I know that tan(\u03c0/4) is 1 because the tangent of 45 degrees is 1. So that means tan(9\u03c0/4) is also 1. But wait, let me double-check my reasoning. Sometimes I might mix up the periods or miscalculate how many times \u03c0 fits into the given angle.\n\nLet me confirm: 9\u03c0/4 divided by \u03c0 is 9/4, which is 2.25. So that's 2 full periods and 0.25 of another period. Since tangent has a period of \u03c0, adding or subtracting any multiple of \u03c0 doesn't change the value. So subtracting 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) from 9\u03c0/4 leaves me with \u03c0/4. \n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, tan(9\u03c0/4) is indeed 1. I think I've got it right. It's always good to verify each step because it's easy to make a small mistake, especially with fractions.\n\nWait another second, let me visualize the unit circle to make sure. So, 9\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, which is a full circle. Specifically, it's 2\u03c0 plus \u03c0/4, which is a little bit more than a full circle. So on the unit circle, that angle would be in the first quadrant, right? Because after 2\u03c0, we start again at 0, so \u03c0/4 is in the first quadrant. \n\nIn the first quadrant, both sine and cosine are positive, which means their ratio, which is tangent, is also positive. So since tan(\u03c0/4) is 1, that should be correct. So, yes, tan(9\u03c0/4) is 1. I think I'm confident with that answer now.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\(\\tan \\frac{9\\pi}{4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. Recognize that the period of the tangent function is \\(\\pi\\). Therefore, subtract multiples of \\(\\pi\\) to find an equivalent angle within one period.\n\n2. Subtract \\(2\\pi\\) from \\(\\frac{9\\pi}{4}\\) to find an equivalent angle:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9\\pi}{4} - 2\\pi = \\frac{9\\pi}{4} - \\frac{8\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. Since \\(\\tan\\) has a period of \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\tan \\frac{9\\pi}{4} = \\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\n\n4. Knowing that \\(\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 1\\), conclude that:\n   \\[\n   \\tan \\frac{9\\pi}{4} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the positive integer divisors of 23. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, I remember that a divisor of a number is another number that can divide it without leaving a remainder. So, for 23, I need to list all the numbers that can divide 23 evenly.\n\nWait, but 23 is a prime number, right? I think that means it only has two divisors: 1 and itself, which is 23. So, if that's the case, the positive integer divisors of 23 are 1 and 23. Now, I need to add these together to get their sum.\n\nLet me write that down to make sure I don't miss anything. So, divisors are 1 and 23. Adding them: 1 + 23 equals 24. That seems straightforward. But let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Sometimes, especially with primes, I might forget about 1 or 23, but I think I accounted for both.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for the sum of divisors. For a prime number p, the sum of its divisors is 1 + p. So, applying that formula here: 1 + 23 equals 24. That confirms my earlier result.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, let me list all the divisors of 23. Starting from 1, since 1 divides every number. Then, 23 divided by 1 is 23, so that's another divisor. There are no other numbers between 1 and 23 that can divide 23 evenly because 23 is prime. So, no, there are no other divisors. So, yes, the only divisors are 1 and 23.\n\nAdding them together: 1 + 23 is 24. So, the sum of the positive integer divisors of 23 is 24.\n\nI think that's it.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when multiplying two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial has to be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Then, I combine like terms. Since the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\), I don't need to multiply all terms, just those that will result in \\( x^2 \\) when multiplied together.\n\nLet me write down the two polynomials again for clarity:\n- First polynomial: \\( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \\)\n- Second polynomial: \\( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \\)\n\nNow, I need to identify which pairs of terms from each polynomial will result in a term with \\( x^2 \\).

So, this term won't contribute to an \\( x^2 \\) term. I can ignore this term for now.\n\n2. **Term \\( -5x^2 \\) in the first polynomial:**\n   - Multiplying \\( -5x^2 \\) by a term in the second polynomial. Let's see:\n     - If I multiply \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( -x^2 \\), that gives \\( (-5)(-1)x^{2+2} = 5x^4 \\).

I'm a bit new to exponents, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, looking at the expression inside the parentheses: 4^4 \u00f7 4^3. I remember that when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So, 4^4 divided by 4^3 should be 4^(4-3) which is 4^1. That simplifies to just 4.

So, 4 \u00b7 256 equals 1024.\n\nPutting it all together, the original expression (4^4 \u00f7 4^3) \u00b7 2^8 simplifies to 4 \u00b7 256, which is 1024. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

How many diagonals does a convex decagon have? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many diagonals a convex decagon has. I remember that a decagon is a 10-sided polygon, but I'm not exactly sure about the formula for the number of diagonals. Let me think about the information given in the problem to see if I can derive it.\n\nThe problem says that a square has two diagonals, and a convex pentagon has five diagonals. So, let's start with these examples to see if we can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nFirst, a square is a 4-sided polygon. It has two diagonals. So, for n=4, the number of diagonals is 2. Now, a pentagon is a 5-sided polygon with five diagonals. So, for n=5, diagonals=5.\n\nI think the general formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon is something like n(n-3)/2. Let me check if this works for the examples we have.\n\nFor n=4: 4(4-3)/2 = 4(1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. That's correct, as a square has two diagonals.\n\nFor n=5: 5(5-3)/2 = 5(2)/2 = 10/2 = 5. That's also correct, as a pentagon has five diagonals.\n\nSo, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for a decagon, which has 10 sides, the number of diagonals would be 10(10-3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 10 multiplied by (10-3) is 10*7=70. Then, 70 divided by 2 is 35. So, 10(10-3)/2 equals 35.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Another way to think about it is that each vertex connects to n-3 other vertices via diagonals because it cannot connect to itself or its two adjacent vertices. So, for each of the n vertices, there are (n-3) diagonals. So, the total number of diagonals would be n(n-3). But wait, that counts each diagonal twice because each diagonal connects two vertices. So, to get the actual number of diagonals, we need to divide by 2. So, the formula is indeed n(n-3)/2.\n\nLet me apply this to a decagon again: n=10. So, 10*(10-3)/2 = 10*7/2 = 70/2 = 35. So, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's think about how the number of diagonals increases as the number of sides increases. For a triangle, which is a 3-sided polygon, it has no diagonals because all the vertices are connected by edges. So, for n=3, the formula gives 3*(3-3)/2 = 0, which is correct.\n\nFor a quadrilateral, like a square, as we saw, it has two diagonals. For n=4, 4*(4-3)/2 = 4*1/2 = 2. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, for a pentagon, n=5, 5*(5-3)/2 = 5*2/2 = 5. That's correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems consistent across different polygons. Therefore, applying it to a decagon, which has 10 sides, should give us 35 diagonals.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't think of any exceptions or other polygons where the formula might not apply, as long as it's a convex polygon, which the problem specifies. So, a convex decagon, which is a 10-sided polygon with all interior angles less than 180 degrees, should have 35 diagonals.\n</think>\n\nThe number of diagonals in a convex decagon is calculated using the formula \\( \\frac{n(n-3)}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of sides. For a decagon (\\( n = 10 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10(10-3)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 7}{2} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35\n\\]\n\nThus, a convex decagon has \\(\\boxed{35}\\) diagonals.",

Like for condition a), N divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1, which is 2-1. Similarly, condition b) N divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, which is 3-1, and so on up to condition d), where N divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 4, which is 5-1.\n\nThat's interesting.

And we're looking for the least such N, so N + 1 should be the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nAlright, so to find the least N, I need to find the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5, and then subtract 1 from it.\n\nLet me recall how to find the LCM of multiple numbers. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of them. One way to find it is to break each number down into its prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the numbers.\n\nSo let's factor each number:\n\n- 2 is already a prime: 2\n- 3 is a prime: 3\n- 4 can be broken down into 2 x 2, so 2\u00b2\n- 5 is a prime: 5\n\nNow, for the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime that appears:\n\n- The highest power of 2 is 2\u00b2 (from 4)\n- The highest power of 3 is 3\u00b9 (from 3)\n- The highest power of 5 is 5\u00b9 (from 5)\n\nSo the LCM is 2\u00b2 x 3\u00b9 x 5\u00b9 = 4 x 3 x 5.\n\nLet me calculate that: 4 x 3 is 12, and 12 x 5 is 60. So the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60.\n\nTherefore, N + 1 = 60, which means N = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\nWait, let me double-check that 59 satisfies all the original conditions.\n\na) 59 divided by 2. 2 x 29 is 58, so remainder is 1.

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this equation to solve: 5 equals (x\u00b3 minus 2x\u00b2 minus 8x) divided by (x plus 2). And I need to find the sum of the x-values that satisfy this equation. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the equation is a rational equation because there's a polynomial in the numerator and another polynomial in the denominator. So, my first thought is to simplify this equation. Maybe I can factor the numerator to cancel out any common factors with the denominator. That might make it easier to solve for x.\n\nLooking at the numerator: x\u00b3 minus 2x\u00b2 minus 8x. I can factor out an x from each term, which gives me x(x\u00b2 minus 2x minus 8). Now, I need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses: x\u00b2 minus 2x minus 8. Let me see if I can factor this into two binomials. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -8 and add up to -2. Let me think: 4 and -2. Yes, because 4 times -2 is -8, and 4 plus (-2) is 2. Wait, but I have a -2x term, so maybe it's -4 and +2. Let me check: -4 times 2 is -8, and -4 plus 2 is -2. Yes, that works. So, the quadratic factors into (x minus 4)(x plus 2).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the numerator becomes x(x minus 4)(x plus 2). The denominator is (x plus 2). Now, I can see that (x plus 2) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. So, I can simplify the fraction by canceling out (x plus 2) from both the numerator and the denominator. That leaves me with x(x minus 4) in the numerator and 1 in the denominator.\n\nSo, after simplifying, the equation becomes 5 equals x(x minus 4). Let me write that out: 5 = x\u00b2 - 4x. Now, I need to solve for x. To do that, I'll bring all terms to one side so that the equation equals zero. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives me 0 = x\u00b2 - 4x - 5.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 4x - 5 = 0. I need to find the values of x that satisfy this equation. I can use the quadratic formula, which is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of (b squared minus 4ac) all over 2a. In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -5.\n\nPlugging those values into the quadratic formula: x equals negative (-4) plus or minus the square root of ((-4)\u00b2 minus 4*1*(-5)) divided by (2*1). Simplifying that: x equals 4 plus or minus the square root of (16 minus (-20)) divided by 2. Wait, 16 minus (-20) is 16 plus 20, which is 36. So, the square root of 36 is 6.\n\nSo, x equals 4 plus or minus 6 divided by 2. Let's compute both possibilities. First, 4 plus 6 is 10, divided by 2 is 5. Second, 4 minus 6 is -2, divided by 2 is -1. So, the solutions are x equals 5 and x equals -1.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that these solutions don't make the original denominator zero. The denominator was (x plus 2), so if x is -2, the denominator would be zero. But neither 5 nor -1 make the denominator zero, so both solutions are valid.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of the x-values that satisfy the equation. So, I need to add 5 and -1 together. 5 plus (-1) is 4. Therefore, the sum of the x-values is 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation: 5 equals (x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x)/(x + 2). Factoring the numerator: x(x\u00b2 - 2x - 8) which factors into x(x - 4)(x + 2). Denominator is (x + 2). So, cancel (x + 2), leaving x(x - 4). So, 5 equals x\u00b2 - 4x. Bringing all terms to one side: x\u00b2 - 4x - 5 = 0. Using quadratic formula: x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 20)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(36)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 6]/2. So, x = (10)/2 = 5, and x = (-2)/2 = -1. Sum is 5 + (-1) = 4. That seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 5 = \\frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Numerator**: Factor \\( x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x \\) as \\( x(x^2 - 2x - 8) \\). Then factor \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\) into \\( (x - 4)(x + 2) \\).

(For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where two farmers agree that pigs are worth $300 and goats are worth $210. They settle debts by exchanging pigs and goats, and if there's change involved, it's either pigs or goats. The question is asking for the smallest positive debt that can be resolved this way.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a problem involving linear combinations because the debts are made up of pigs and goats. So, if I can find the smallest amount that can be expressed as a combination of $300 and $210, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, so this is similar to the concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD) in number theory. The GCD of two numbers is the smallest number that can be expressed as a linear combination of those two numbers. So, in this case, the smallest positive debt should be the GCD of 300 and 210.\n\nLet me verify that. The GCD of 300 and 210 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm. Let's see:\n\nFirst, divide 300 by 210. 210 goes into 300 once with a remainder. 300 - 210 = 90. So, the remainder is 90.\n\nNow, take 210 and divide it by 90. 90 goes into 210 twice with a remainder. 210 - 90*2 = 210 - 180 = 30. So, the remainder is 30.\n\nNext, take 90 and divide it by 30. 30 goes into 90 three times exactly with no remainder. So, the remainder is 0.\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder is 30. Therefore, the GCD of 300 and 210 is 30.\n\nSo, that means the smallest positive debt that can be resolved using pigs and goats is $30.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here. The problem says that debts are settled by exchanging pigs and goats, with change received as necessary. So, in this case, since the GCD is 30, any debt that is a multiple of 30 can be settled using pigs and goats. So, the smallest positive debt is indeed 30.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $30.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest positive debt that can be resolved using pigs and goats is $30.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Values:**\n   - Pigs are worth $300.\n   - Goats are worth $210.\n\n2. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - Debts are settled by exchanging pigs and goats.\n   - Change is received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary.\n\n3. **Recognize the Mathematical Concept:**\n   - This problem involves finding the smallest positive debt, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of pigs and goats.\n\n4. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm to Find the GCD:**\n   - **Step 1:** Divide 300 by 210.\n     - 210 goes into 300 once with a remainder of 90.\n     - Remainder = 300 - (210 * 1) = 90.\n   - **Step 2:** Divide 210 by 90.\n     - 90 goes into 210 twice with a remainder of 30.\n     - Remainder = 210 - (90 * 2) = 30.\n   - **Step 3:** Divide 90 by 30.\n     - 30 goes into 90 three times exactly with no remainder.\n     - Remainder = 90 - (30 * 3) = 0.\n\n5. **Determine the GCD:**\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 30, which is the GCD of 300 and 210.\n\n6. **Conclude the Smallest Positive Debt:**\n   - Since the GCD is 30, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved using pigs and goats is $30.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{30}",
